Executive Summary

  
The landscape of blockchain-based gaming is rapidly expanding behind the rise of NFTs and in-game currencies. Its growth can be seen as a continuation of a multi-decade iteration across monetization strategies and business models.

The rise of worldwide interest in video games and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the last few years serve as large catalysts. Globally, the number of video gamers is quickly approaching 3 billion with a projected 5-7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years. Meanwhile, NFT sales surpassed $15 billion for the first time ever in 2021. In fact, secondary sales of the NFTs found in blockchain games themselves accounted for 20% of total NFT sales – with dozens of smaller games consistently generating tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

Finally, while the metaverse remains vague, it’s clear that gaming, in particular, has a strong presence in virtual worlds. Virtual world games, like Decentraland and The Sandbox, have generated nearly $500 million in cumulative NFT sales (virtual land and in-game assets). In 2021, virtual world NFT sales witnessed the largest growth, generating over $320 million in transaction volume. As the global understanding of the metaverse further contextualizes, it’s likely that some portion of this new digital experience will utilize blockchains as a core piece of infrastructure – something even more likely to occur as blockchain infrastructure continues to scale to meet the demands of developers and consumers.

This report will dive deeper into the growth of all three categories: Global gaming, NFT markets, and blockchain games. Though  the industry remains in its infancy, understanding these trends will help provide insights into what the future of gaming may hold.

Introduction to Blockchain Gaming

  
Like its fictional characters, the business of games keeps evolving. The industry lies at the edge of disruption, where it has historically discovered innovations and adapted them to ever-changing demands.

Take the evolution of gaming business models as an example. The first mainstream games featured a pay-to-play system. We remember these games predominantly as arcade machines in malls or CD discs in computers or, later on, direct downloads onto machines. The advantage with pay-to-play was simple: Pay just one time; keep playing forever.

After pay-to-play came the freemium model of games. Gamers no longer needed to pay to start playing a game in this era. Rather, companies made revenue from players paying to unlock additional components of the game, or more commonly, from sales of in-game purchases such as expansion packs, platform subscriptions, and character cosmetics. For many, freemium games lowered gaming’s barriers to entry and the shift to freemium games helped grow the number of gamers around the globe.

That takes us to today, where the beginnings of gaming’s next monetization revolution lie around the corner: blockchain gaming. The blockchain gaming sector has earned other names like GameFi or play-to-earn indicative of the new monetization models of this gaming era. Blockchain gaming typically incorporates non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other forms of tokenized assets as in-game content tradeable for cryptocurrencies – or fiat currency – on markets facilitated by the blockchain. Thus, this core monetization strategy occurs in the form of sales of tokenized assets and subsequent royalty proceeds. Game studios and players share aligned incentives in this new business model since both parties benefit when the game’s tokenized assets increase in value.

At the heart of this revolution is the idea that gamers should own the content they earn, or at least have more ownership in the digital worlds in which they spend a significant portion of their time and money. This creates two immediate advantages: (1) The longevity of in-game assets increases as those assets continue to exist in their owners’ wallets even after the game is turned off, and (2) both the interoperability and composability of assets – terms describing their portability – enable them to interact with other games, applications, or blockchains. Interoperability among different blockchains allows gamers to lend out their in-game assets, port them to another application, or gain access to real-world events. In addition, blockchains have the potential to offer gamers the ability to safely and efficiently buy, sell, trade, and create in-game assets with fiat or crypto even within the same application; gray secondary markets for games can be rife with fraud, and many emerging markets lack the payments infrastructure for gamers to seamlessly make game-related transactions.

While blockchain gaming can be a new monetization source for game studios, it should be warned that the decision to enter the world of blockchain doesn’t come without its own pitfalls. The recent announcement of Ubisoft Quartz, an in-game NFT marketplace of sorts, was met with skepticism from fans, leading to plans of including NFTs in the new game Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Breakpoint getting scrapped. This followed after the popular gaming community Discord saw similar pushback after hinting at integration with Ethereum. The main reasons behind the community pushback were sustainability, unclear user value proposition and the prevalence of rug pulls, among many others. Many if not all of these concerns could have been avoided or alleviated with more deliberate, thought-out rollouts alongside market education; introduction of NFT profile pictures by Twitter and Adidas’ foray into NFTs have shown an encouraging path forward for platforms and intellectual property owners to learn from.

The Global Gaming Market

Gaming is one of the most popular sources of entertainment and it is only expanding. Major franchises such as Fortnite and League of Legends now operate in the global pop culture arena. Fortnite, for example, has partnered with Marvel Studios, Star Wars, and John Wick in the movie industry, worked with Ariana Grande, Neymar, and other influential celebrities, and coordinated with popular brands such as Balenciaga, Ferrari, and Air Jordan. League of Legends, on the other hand, hosts an international-sports league drawing millions of fans.

Anecdotes aside, the global gaming market cannot be evaluated without taking the last two years into perspective. In 2020, lockdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic acted as a strong catalyst for the industry. Those who were already gamers found themselves with more time to play their favorite games. Meanwhile, individuals who didn’t play games found themselves with time on their hands to experiment with fresh hobbies. Consequently, global gaming revenue grew 15% in 2020. Mobile, PC, and console games each saw growth with mobile, in particular, surging 26% year over year.

Unfortunately, businesses in 2021 faced a different story. The pandemic’s prolonged disruptions began to highlight unexpected second-order effects in the global gaming market. Disruptions to manufacturing, freight, and logistics processes hindered the launches of next-generation consoles, and PC hardware faced chip shortages and delays on other high-end components.

Despite the ongoing increased interest in gaming seen in 2020, both PC and console segments saw slight decreases compared to 2020 and mobile was the only category to experience growth, due to these supply chain disruptions and tough comps.

Forecasts do expect the gaming industry to revert back to the previous levels of growth once the effects of Covid-19 subside. Predictions have the industry reaching $269 billion by 2025, a 53% increase from recent numbers. Over the upcoming three-year period, these fall in line with recent years’ historical 15% CAGR growth, driven by continued changes in consumer behavior post-pandemic and new revenue monetization models from streaming and professional esports.

Meanwhile, the number of total gamers worldwide is predicted to hit just under the three billion mark with 55% coming from the Asia-Pacific region. The main drivers for an ever-increasing user base remain an expanding internet population, better networking infrastructure, and easier accessibility to smartphones.

These three drivers outlined continue to be reliable for the short term, but as more of the world comes online in regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America and user growth slows, exploring new avenues to increase participants will be of interest to many companies. Blockchain gaming and its new token-based monetization models present a unique opportunity for game developers to generate more in-game revenue per customer, broaden their customer base, and explore new revenue streams.

Non-Fungible Tokens: Game Changers

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) act as a core primitive for blockchain assets and as a key value proposition of various blockchain games. NFTs in blockchain games provide various benefits to games including asset ownership, asset programmability, and open new opportunities to incentivization and innovation.

Asset Ownership  
In legacy games, in-game assets are controlled and owned by the game developer and effectively rented out to players. Comparably, in blockchain games, players retain genuine ownership over their digital assets, whether in-game currency or more unique assets like skins, account names, in-game land, or other assets.

Asset Programmability  
Since NFTs are essentially software on blockchain networks, these assets can be programmed to have various qualities or built with in-game utility. NFTs can be designed with single-usage, unlockable content, issued to players that achieve a certain status, or programmed with a number of other unique use cases.

Incentivization and Innovation  
Game developers are already amongst the most knowledgeable when it comes to incentives. NFTs offer an additional layer of economic incentives by enabling players to earn yield-generating assets, imbue gaming assets with real financial value, and build a more robust gaming economy via in-game currencies and NFT marketplaces.

Since blockchain networks are permissionless, they open up the doors to developer innovation. With NFTs, a single asset category can be automatically licensed to other companies or leveraged in other games. Sorare – the fantasy soccer NFT game – has licensed the usage of its NFTs with other game developers like Ubisoft.

Finally, NFTs also open new forms of monetization. For instance, NFTs issued by companies can earn royalties on all secondary sales producing a new revenue stream for digital asset issuers. Companies can choose to vertically integrate their own marketplaces and activities or integrate with third-party platforms like OpenSea.

The Growth of NFTs: Analyzing The Secondary Market

Total NFT secondary sales in 2021 surpassed $15 billion across multiple blockchain networks. As a platform, Ethereum leads NFT sales. However, increased transaction costs on the network have paved the way for newer blockchains and Layer-2 scaling solutions like Solana, Ronin, ImmutableX, Polygon, and more.

Each blockchain or Layer-2 comes with its own set of tradeoffs, including scalability, existing infrastructure, users, and security among others. As such, there’s a variety of game developers building on different blockchains for different reasons. Games that require greater scalability might opt for blockchains like Solana while game developers desiring to utilize Ethereum’s  
existing network effects may select Polygon, ImmutableX, or another Ethereum scaling solution.

In hindsight, August 2021 was the peak monthly activity in 2021 with over $4.5 billion in NFT secondary sales.

Although the last few months of 2021 still lagged compared to the peak, it’s important to realize the NFT secondary market is still multiples larger than where it was at the start of 2021. With a growing number of applications and marketplaces that integrate various forms of tokens including NFTs, the NFT secondary market will be poised to retest the level of engagement last seen during August 2021.

Note these charts represent secondary sales, meaning the sale from one person to another. This data, therefore, excludes the initial NFT sale from the gaming company to the first buyer, which can produce meaningful revenue. Secondary sales are a useful metric for gauging the health of both the overall NFT market and the health of an individual game. Increased secondary sales likely translate to a more robust gaming economy and since NFT collections often pass a perpetual royalty to the company at each sale, a healthy secondary market also directly corresponds to increased revenue for the NFT issuer.

Data shows Axie Infinity is the clear leader in secondary NFT sales, the vast majority of which occur on its sidechain Ronin. More recently, ParallelAlpha, another strategy card game, has grown in recent months in part due to its intriguing SciFi backstory and intellectual property. Overall, there exist several successful games with over $100 million in secondary NFT sales across multiple blockchain networks, showing that there’s still no clear consensus on which platform is best suited for blockchain-based games.

Also worth mentioning is the fact that most successful blockchain games today are predominantly card games, compared to the existing gaming industry which favors sandbox games, MMORPGs, and games with more robust gaming experiences.

Currently, blockchain games are not at the stage of development in which they can support both complex gameplay and economic primitives like NFTs at scale. However, in time, advancements in blockchain technology and user experiences – including improvements launching in the coming year – will open the doors for higher functioning games that operate on blockchain networks.

The Blockchain Gaming Landscape

As the blockchain-gaming sector gains momentum, the gaming infrastructure stack has also quickly evolved and is now composed of an ecosystem of studios, games, and key pieces of infrastructure.

Let’s break down the various layers of the blockchain gaming landscape.

Gaming Guilds

  
Guilds aren’t new to blockchain gaming. These social groups – guilds – have been utilized in role-playing games for decades. However, the combination of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)—an entity formed by a community that is organized around a set of rules enforced on a blockchain, usually with no central leadership structure—and gaming enables these guilds to ingest and allocate capital which creates new models for gaming financialization and user acquisition. Well-capitalized guilds like Yield Guild Games, GuildFi, and Merit Circle have sponsored—delegated assets in exchange for part of the game rewards—hundreds of players for games like Axie Infinity.

Blockchain Games

The largest layer of the blockchain gaming landscape is the games themselves. To date, there exist a variety of game types. Some of the most successful categories include trading card games (e.g. Axie Infinity), MMORPGs(e.g. DeFi Kingdoms), Virtual Worlds (e.g. The Sandbox), and sports games (e.g. Sorare).

As the gaming landscape evolves, dominant blockbuster games will emerge from each sector. However, many games are currently under development and may take months or years to fully develop.

Marketplaces

As games issue assets as NFTs, general marketplaces like OpenSea offer access as well as blockchain-specific marketplaces like Metaplex, VIVE, and Magic Eden that facilitate transactions. Further, some pieces of gaming infrastructure like Enjin offer their own marketplaces for Enjin SDK-developed games.

Launchpads

Launchpads effectively help upstart game developers raise capital for game development. Often these launchpads raise capital for a specific gaming ecosystem (i.e. Polkastarter for Polkadot) or Magic Eden for Solana). Typically, launchpads enable fundraising through either an initial DEX offering (IDO) or liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP), each of which enables the initial sale of tokens.

Gaming Development Infrastructure

Game development infrastructure like Forte and Enjin often have APIs and SDKs that enable game developers to quickly integrate NFTs or other crypto-economic activities. Building the entire blockchain infrastructure required for a game from scratch can be daunting and time-consuming for game developers. Just as blockchain developers leverage existing smart contract tooling and wallet infrastructure, game developers can leverage blockchain game development software (i.e. Stardust, Enjin, Forte) that supports modular components such as wallets, asset issuance, payments, and other foundational features.

Layer-2 Infrastructure

The NFT bull market of 2021 resulted in increased investment from Layer-2s into the gaming ecosystem. Axie Infinity chose to vertically integrate, developing its own sidechain, Ronin, and its own DEX, Katana. Elsewhere game development platforms like Enjin have chosen to horizontally integrate, recently <a href=""https://messari.io/intel/event/a18131ee-379e-4dcd-8d04-b866b5fbd628"">securing</a> a Polkadot parachain auction for Efinity. Still, many existing games are committed to building on Ethereum’s existing network effects, leveraging Starkware (e.g. Sorare), ImmutableX (e.g. Gods Unchained), Polygon (e.g. Zed Run), and others for their scaling needs.

Layer-1 Infrastructure

Layer-1 infrastructure serves as the core foundation for various protocols and applications. While some games are building higher throughput blockchains like Solana and Flow, most Ethereum games have migrated to Layer-2 solutions. The importance of Layer-1s comes from the other composable protocols that games will leverage, including guilds, financialization protocols(e.g. NFTX), identity solutions (e.g. ENS), marketplaces, and other applications or services.

Game Studios

Studios sit at the base layer of the landscape since they are often developers of games as well as Layer-1 and Layer-2 infrastructure. Dapper, Sky Mavis, and Animoca Brands sit as the most well-capitalized game developers with hundreds of millions in capital. Ultimately, not every gaming studio will survive. However, those that develop the next blockbuster games have the potential to become the next Electronics Arts of the future.

Blockchain Games Gain Interest

The first blockchain game was created in late 2017, but it wasn’t until the recent mainstream foray into NFTs that the subsector found substantial user engagement. With the popularity of games like Axie Infinity and mainstream collectibles like NBA Top Shot, blockchain-based games are now on the precipice of wider adoption.

User and Funding Metrics

Although blockchain gamers comprise a small percentage of the three billion global gamers, recent data released by DappRadar shows October 2021 was the first month where over one million unique daily active wallets interacted with decentralized gaming apps. This number reflects an almost 300% increase from four months prior where the same metric showed only 350K wallet interactions.

The monthly unique number of NFT buyers of blockchain games is also on the rise. To date, most blockchain games require an individual to own NFTs which places an initial capital burden on gamers, much like purchasing a console. While this model remains the most popular today, it’s likely that more games will experiment with free-to-play models in the future.

Following the Funding

Apart from wallets as an adoption proxy, another important metric to track is venture funding. Capital investments reflect many things: It reflects interest in the industry; it reflects, to some extent, the ambitions of founders in the space; and it reflects, to a greater degree, the resources at hand available to those challenging the status quo. It’s worth analyzing how the fundraising environment has changed this past year.

Not surprisingly, the numbers continue to further highlight the growth of this subsector. Total venture funding across game titles and ecosystem infrastructure increased more than 100x compared to 2020. The jump still represents a roughly 40x increase from funding in 2018, the year in which funding was at its peak prior to 2021.

Venture funding in 2021 came in such a stark contrast to previous years that multiple businesses raised rounds larger than the sum of all previous years combined. Examples include Forte, an end-to-end blockchain gaming development platform partnering with a host of gaming studios. Perhaps what’s notable about this data is the variety of products and services in this list: Both studios and infrastructure/tooling are represented, not to mention other components of the gaming stack including NFT marketplaces and various Layer-1 or Layer-2 blockchains.

Beyond fundraising amounts, the origination of funding also shifted this past year. Crypto-specific venture funds were no longer the sole game in town. This past year, those who have made investments in the space now include traditional tech funds such as Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Lightspeed Partners, as well as hedge funds with established track records in growth investing, notably Tiger Global and Coatue Management. On a go-forward basis, this triumvirate of players – particularly the fresh participants – should continue to bring new capital into the ecosystem.

Developer Initiatives

Moreover, a recent study of 157 developers in the United States and United Kingdom found 72% of those surveyed have considered integrating blockchain technology into their games, whereas 58% of the same group have plans to do so in the next 12 months. Meanwhile, 47% of participants are already using NFTs in their games, highlighting considerable interest from the developer side.

While developers see an opportunity for new content, it should be reiterated that the technology behind such games remains nascent. Furthermore, current challenges around blockchain such as transaction costs, throughput speed, and general scalability limit gameplay mostly to turn-based, card-collecting games rather than the live-action and 3D graphics of AAA-rated games released by high budget studios.

Blockchain Game Case Studies

In the following section, we’ll take a look at the growth of three recognizable blockchain games, their models, and what they mean for the blockchain gaming ecosystem.

Axie Infinity  
Widely recognized as the most popular game to date, Axie Infinity has facilitated over $3.5 billion in cumulative volume within its NFT marketplace. The premise of the game is similar to Pokemon. Players own and breed Axie champions, represented as tradeable NFT characters, who go on to either complete adventure levels or battle champions owned by computer opponents or other humans in the Axie Infinity realm.

Successful battles or conquests lead to in-game rewards, which can be sold for real-world currency. Axie Infinity spawned the global adoption of the play-to-earn business model. It is estimated 40% of total players are from the Philippines alone, where gamers can earn upwards of $500 per month from playing. Gameplay revolves around two crypto tokens: Smooth Love Potions (SLP) tokens and Axie Infinity Shard (AXS) tokens.

SLP Tokens: SLP tokens are more widely used for practical in-game purposes and grant holders the ability to breed new Axie champions. The process consists of burning SLP tokens to birth a new Axie creature. SLP tokens can be earned through regular gameplay, bought on secondary marketplaces, or engagement with promotional offers.
AXS Tokens: AXS tokens are the governance token for the Axie Infinity game. Those who own AXS tokens can stake the token inside the network to earn yield. These tokens are also used as currency within the game’s NFT marketplace.

Axie Infinity derives its protocol revenue from various fee mechanisms. The first such mechanism is marketplace fees earned as a percentage of sales facilitated through the NFT marketplace. The other main revenue stream comes from breeding fees paid by players to create new Axie creatures in the game. Two smaller revenue sources include fees earned from sales of in-game land and the original sale of first-generation Axie creatures.

In sum, the protocol has earned over $1.3bn in revenue from these four sources, with almost all of it occurring after June 2021. This timing coincides with Sky Mavis’s launch of the Ronin network, which helped decrease transaction costs for its users and boosted the game’s popularity.

Segmentation of revenue seems to support this conclusion. Over 99% of total cumulative revenue is derived from activity on the Ronin network. Ethereum merely accounts for 0.19% of the $1.3bn while including revenue earned from land sales and first-generation Axie sales, both of which are not available on the Ronin network. Thus, Ronin’s 99%+ revenue claim is another indicator of the incredible activity from breeding and marketplace fees alone.

The graph below demonstrates just how much growth occurred in the second half of the year. Surprisingly, revenue begins to tail off in the last few weeks of 2021. Potential explanations for this include the recent Typhoon Rai wreaking havoc in the Philippines (where 40% of total users reside) or shifting interest towards blockchain games with newer gameplay.

Although Axie Infinity's circulating market capitalization did fall in recent weeks as revenue growth slowed, a rough benchmark did find the game still comparable with many pure-play game studios. Notably, this methodology compares a singular game (Axie Infinity) with game studios that own multiple titles – further demonstrating how sizable this one blockchain game has become.

Axie Infinity lags behind the largest industry players such as Nintendo, Activision Blizzard, and Electronic Arts – all of which have triple-A rated game studios – but much closer to several others. In the benchmark below, Axie Infinity has a similar circulating market cap as Ubisoft, the creator of famous games like Assassin's Creed and the Tom Clancy series.

Sorare  
Much like fantasy sports, Sorare offers its players the opportunity to blend real-world sports with digital games – only this time with the inclusion of blockchain technology. Think FIFA Ultimate Team with NFT cards as collectibles. Up to now, Sorare gameplay is limited to football (or soccer, in the United States) as the sport of choice, though the company recently raised $680 million in September to support its continued expansion.

Sorare tracks real-world football stats, rewarding players who own the NFT cards of high-performing athletes. Naturally the nature of the game draws a broad audience of football fans. As reflected above, first-time buyers of Sorare NFTs surged in the second half of 2021. The total unique monthly buyers of Sorare NFTs surpassed 20,000 for the first time in December 2021. Data presented here should be noted under a backdrop where, unlike Axie Infinity, gamers aren’t required to purchase NFTs to start playing. This likely means the total number of Sorare gamers exceeds those who made secondary NFT purchases.

Sorare is one of the most successful cases to date of NFTs merging with culture. The participation of influential football leagues, including some of the most popular in the world like the English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, and Europe’s top-tier Champions League, and willingness to lend their brand to a blockchain game, is a precursor for future games to come.

DeFi Kingdoms  
Another blockchain game, DeFi Kingdoms, bears resemblance to a popular Internet classic, Runescape. Gamers of the latter may feel some nostalgia as virtual characters interact with one another within a retro pixel art world. Unlike Axie Infinity or Sorare, the gameplay of DeFi Kingdoms doesn’t revolve around collecting and battling with cards. Instead, the game incorporates heroes, quests, professions, and a broader array of actionable activities such as mining, gardening, farming, and fishing. The roadmap for the game is massively ambitious. Future gameplay will allow Heroes to join guilds, engage in peer-to-peer battles, hatch pets, and more. Having heroes participate in these various tasks boosts the gamer’s odds of accumulating resources tradeable on blockchain markets.

DeFi Kingdoms, as its namesake suggests, blends elements of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), with a larger focus on the latter than many predecessors. The game includes a decentralized exchange, liquidity staking, and native NFT marketplace – all services found in the crypto ecosystem but not traditionally within a blockchain game. In fact, the team behind the game took a reverse approach to that taken by Axie Infinity; instead of starting with the game, DeFi Kingdoms began with traditional liquidity mining incentives and is growing the game out with time.

The selected blockchain running the game is Harmony. What’s notable about DeFi Kingdom’s launch on Harmony is the sheer dominance of the project across the blockchain network. DeFi Kingdom owns approximately 68% of all Total Value Locked (TVL), a significantly larger share than the two main DEXs active on the network, SushiSwap, and ViperSwap. A launch of DeFi Kingdoms on Avalanche is also expected to be released within the next few months.

Usage data does seem to support the idea of the game gaining interest. Daily user count has continually trended upward since its launch. In early December, the game announced it would expand to Avalanche with the launch of a new realm called Crystalvale. On the date of the news, it was announced Avalanche DEXs such as Trader Joe and Pangolin would immediately begin providing liquidity for DeFi Kingdom’s new Avalanche-purposed in-game token; a few days later, the number of users active on Harmony jumped 64% before giving back some of those gains. Transaction volume also jumped 29% over the following two-week period.

The Metaverse

On a broader scale, much of what’s happening in gaming is moving in tandem with another major technology trend: the metaverse. Perhaps the metaverse has already touched your life – it wasn’t too long ago Facebook strategically rebranded itself as Meta – but if it hasn’t, odds are high it will over the next few years.

Defining the metaverse is a little unclear in part because the concept itself remains largely hypothetical. At its base, the metaverse represents a collection of virtual worlds (including AR, VR, and two-dimensional) where we can engage with each other in a digital format. But as it stands today, multiple worlds simultaneously exist, the ecosystem is fragmented, and competition is fierce among those vying to lay the framework for which world applications ultimately get built on.

Regardless of the metaverse’s final form, opportunities for in-game integrations are mostly unexplored. The metaverse widens the scope of gaming by unlocking new types of intellectual property, experiences, and behavior. One early example is Worldwide Webb, an interoperable massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Worldwide Webb allows users to import owned NFTs into the game to serve as digital identities, which marks one of the first  
instances where NFT cross-application interoperability appeared in blockchain-enabled digital worlds.

Virtual Worlds Dominance

Since Decentraland’s ICO in August 2017, virtual worlds have long been discussed as a potential application within the metaverse. These virtual worlds are designed to be sandbox games (e.g. Minecraft, Roblox, etc.) where players can buy and build their own assets as well as socialize with other gamers.

The top four leading metaverse worlds are The Sandbox, Decentraland, Somnium Spaces, and Cryptovoxels. Each of these virtual worlds enables users to purchase scarce digital land and many of these also utilize their own in-game currency (e.g. The Sandbox’s Sand).

To date, some of these virtual worlds have gained notoriety for specific use cases. For instance, Cryptovoxels users have created 3D art studios and Decentraland hosts casinos and digital offices for various crypto companies.

Virtual worlds have generated nearly $500 million in cumulative NFT sales (virtual land and in-game assets). In 2021, virtual world NFT sales witnessed the largest growth, generating over $320 million in NFT sales.

The Sandbox led virtual worlds by a large margin with over $235 million in sales. Moreover, Decentraland and The Sandbox both experienced 490% and 739% growth in NFT sales in Q4 alone, respectively.

As awareness of the metaverse increases, synchronous virtual worlds have experienced increased speculation. Ultimately, these applications are in their infancy, still building content for gamers and trying to find their niche among potential users (i.e. social, gaming).

The unique value proposition of blockchain networks – asset ownership, permissionless innovation, incentive design, and programmability – likely ensures that these protocols will support the metaverse as a foundational layer or as crucial parts of infrastructure for the secondary and tertiary applications and services.

Conclusion

Over the past year, it’s undeniable that blockchain gaming experienced a watershed moment – a historical shift on which future development depends. The perception of blockchain gaming has changed because of successful games like Axie Infinity, the explosive growth of NFT secondary sales, and the broad growth of crypto adopters and more specifically the expansion of blockchain gaming users. In turn, this has catalyzed further funding into the blockchain gaming landscape across a variety of core pieces of infrastructure and dozens of new games and studios.

The tailwinds of the metaverse have also benefited the gaming industry, which makes up a significant portion of online activity today and will likely be an important area of growth and user acquisition for companies building in the metaverse.

Blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum are developing at an increasing pace, but scaling challenges and user experience issues persist. Still, there are many teams developing solutions for both consumers and game developers to enhance the experience of building and playing blockchain games. Although a common monetization model across blockchain games has yet to emerge, the experiments around issuing NFTs, vertical marketplaces, in-game currencies, and other crypto-economic primitives remain promising.

Key Takeaways

While primary sales volume remained flat, secondary sales volume grew 1,685% compared to the prior quarter. Notes this report only includes Sandbox Sales from OpenSea.
The number of active buyers rose ~37% compared to the last quarter and grew each quarter of 2021.
The Sandbox launched its limited Alpha version of its gameplay in November 2021 which drew thousands of players.
The most traded LANDs of The Sandbox virtual worlds are within the bottom left quadrant

Introduction to The Sandbox

The Sandbox is a gaming metaverse – virtual world – where players and creators can make 3D assets and experiences (e.g. games) that can be monetized via NFTs.

The Sandbox ecosystem leverages a variety of tokenized gaming features including:

SAND – a digital in-game currency used for purchases, monetization, and asset creation
LAND – digital ownable land within the Sandbox virtual world
ESTATE – a combination of LANDs to create a larger plot
GAMES – a bundle of assets and scripting logic to create interactive experiences
ASSETS – 3D virtual images created by players
GEMS – tokens burnt to give attributes to assets
CATALYSTS – tokens burnt to create ASSETS

The Sandbox provides Mindcraft-esque gameplay with digital ownership and more robust in-game economics due to the tradeable nature of $SAND and the other assets within the Sandbox virtual world.

Sandbox offers a variety of in-game NFTs as well as user-generated NFTs. The VoxEdit NFT builder is used for creating 3D objects (ASSETS) such as avatars, creatures, buildings, and other tools.

Macro Overview

LANDS are blockchain-backed tokens (using the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens, aka NFTs) representing physical parcels of The Sandbox Metaverse. There is a finite amount of Sandbox LAND – 166,464 parcels of which 62% have already been distributed.

New parcels are released for sale through auctions or at specific price points. In 2021, The Sandbox recorded over $350 million in LAND sales volume.

Notably, 80% of The Sandbox's total LAND volume occurred in the final quarter with secondary sales making up for nearly all of fourth-quarter volume. While primary sales volume remained flat, secondary sales volume grew 1,685% compared to the prior quarter.

Since The Sandbox had a player-capped Alpha release, tracking its active daily or monthly users isn’t useful at this point. However, the number of active buyers rose ~37% compared to the last quarter and grew each quarter of 2021.

More interestingly, the increase in secondary sales volume and growth in buyers resulted in a 25% turnover in the total LAND assets.

With 26,000 secondary LAND sales and around 15,000 unique buyers, it's likely that large owners are selling some of their LAND supply and that a subset of buyers are actively trading digital LAND.

Sandbox Micro Overview - Land Analysis

The median price of Sandbox LAND has appreciated from $1,308 at the end of Q3 to a median price of $11,364 by the end of Q4. This nearly 10x increase of the median price is due in part to the growing trend of the metaverse and Sandbox's continued expansion. Upon announcement of its Series B, Sandbox LAND appreciated significantly peaking in December.

The Sandbox LAND Map

By analyzing The Sandbox virtual world by total LAND volume per parcel, we’re able to determine which LANDs have been traded the most. Parcels in The Sandbox are separated into 1x1, 3x3, 6x6, 12x12, and 24x24 parcel plots. The heatmap shows the plots that have witnessed the highest aggregate trade volume on the secondary markets. This effectively helps determine which plots of LAND are most desirable (that have been available for sale).

The redder plots – indicating more trade volume – are predominantly clustered within the lower left quadrant of The Sandbox. One potential explanation is that as The Sandbox has expanded, traders have been drawn towards expanding regions of the map.

Diving deeper, the reddest 12x12 plot is located (outlined in red) adjacent of the Yield Guild Games ESTATE and possesses multiple LANDS for sale on OpenSea (indicated by white boxes). It’s possible being close to YGG or Stakefish (the Doge dog ESTATE) makes the next-door land more valuable.

The second most speculated on plot (outlined in red) is near the first most traded 12x12 plot and shares a border with Atari, Ludena Protocol, and is close to two Sandbox-owned ESTATES. However, unlike the previous plot, this one has fewer OpenSea listings currently available.

Notably, many of the largest ESTATES (24x24), especially within the center, have low aggregate trading volume. There are a few potential explanations for this effect. First, some potentially coveted parcels don’t trade often and many large ESTATES are owned by The Sandbox or their IP partners which are focused on building within the virtual world. Second, even the highest individual parcels have only sold for $100k-$245k which is below the heat maps second tier. Lastly, it’s possible that large owners don’t really care about making small profits on LAND and are looking to hold onto the LAND for a longer time period.

Interestingly, the top 400 parcels by aggregate volume account for 32.5% of the total volume of the over 16,000 lands that have been traded at least once.

There is a clear concentration in the top 100 LANDs which account for nearly 17% of the total aggregate volume, showing that the top land within the Sandbox metaverse experiences significant volume.

One potential reason for this relatively high concentration of volume is that many LANDs haven’t entered the secondary market with the original owner hanging onto their parcels or ESTATES.

The Top LAND Owners

The top LAND owners are predominantly investors in The Sandbox (i.e. Binance, Galaxy Interactive, NFT communities (i.e. Whale, MetaKovan, Kongz), or large crypto-focused companies that have committed to building within The Sandbox Metaverse.

The top 5 LAND owners – one of which is The Sandbox – own 11% of the total LAND supply. Evaluating the percentage of ownership in a digital world is novel to ensure that 1) the amount owned by any one entity decreases over time, thereby facilitating greater in-world entrepreneurship and 2) monitoring that the LAND owners are actively building on their parcels as opposed to holding for speculative purposes.

High Priced (Virtual) Real Estate

It’s worth noting that the Sandbox Heatmap above groups 12x12 parcels to see the total LAND volume and so the most speculated individual parcels of land (most aggregate volume) aren’t necessarily within the highest volume 12x12 grouping. The top five largest purchases – highest price paid for a single parcel of LAND – all exceed $100,000.

Cayson.eth, paid $245,000 for a single parcel of land. The buyer – who also owns BAYC 8435 – purchased the 35 surrounding plots for a total $547,119 ($15,632 per unit) and required the final parcel to create a 6x6 (36 plot) ESTATE.

Olikars.eth holds the second, tenth, and fourteenth largest LAND purchases, spending a combined 80 ETH ($343,000) to acquire all three parcels. The account immediately transferred the assets to 0x2793999444f916254ea15b41403c111e9b610465 and then later to 0x64596df940be25aa5186b095c326dcca4660562d. One of the top purchased plots is adjacent to the future Walking Dead game. The other two plots are adjacent to the Atari RollerCoasterTycoon World and the Atari XL ESTATES.

Sandbox user Ksaffy – and BAYC #2765 owner – holds the title for the third largest plot transaction, purchasing a parcel near The Sandbox Central Hub where all players spawn into the game.

The fourth-largest transaction – $101,883 – was by Sandbox user CryptoSue for a single plot located adjacent to the Snoop Dog ESTATE and Weedbits plot. Finally, Club9.eth ranks fifth for the largest transaction purchasing plot 55816 for 24 ETH ($101,760) in November 2021 and later sold the same plot in January 2021 for 3.5 ETH for a significant loss. This same plot was sold again several days later for $4.67 ETH to an unknown wallet.

Anecdotally, the top purchases are typically LAND owners trying to acquire specific plots of land whether that be next to ESTATES, user experiences (i.e. games, concerts), or important locations (e.g. near the spawn point) that the buyer likely believes will help drive traffic to their parcel.

Sandbox Ecosystem: Governance & Notable Events

Fundraising & Capital Expenditure

The Sandbox completed its $93 million Series B fundraising round in November led by Softbank. Sandbox has taken a distinct approach towards in-game content partnering with various brands and licensing intellectual property for dozens of companies. In a press release, The Sandbox state that the new capital will also be used to expand its IP licensing efforts and grow its virtual world.

Subsequently, in December, The Sandbox completed a round with Hong Kong based entrepreneur Adrian Cheng to purchase an ESTATE of land within The Sandbox. The plot was purchased from The Sandbox’s “Mega City”, a location set to emulate Hong Kong with ownership across a variety of Hong Kong-based companies and prominent individuals.

Sandbox Alpha

In November of 2021, The Sandbox launched the long-awaited Alpha version of its virtual world which enabled users to interact with other players and explore the “Main Hub” of the Sandbox Universe. As part of the Sandbox Alpha, the Sandbox released 4 NFT avatar collections – Agora, Gearbox, Ducks, and Faction. The Sandbox Alpha was limited to 5,000 passes and had thousands of NFTs distributed to game players. As The Sandbox looks towards growing its user base, the next season of its Alpha is scheduled for May 1, 2022.

Polygon Integration

While Sand already maintains a liquidity pool on Uniswap with Ethereum gas fees making gaming on Ethereum’s base layer untenable, The Sandbox announced its intention to integrate with Polygon starting with an mSAND  MATIC staking pool on Quickswap. All Sandbox transactions incur a 5% fee, of which 2.5% is allocated to the various staking pools.

Since there are a variety of transactions required interacting with The Sandbox virtual world (marketplaces, NFT creation, etc) Polygon will enable more interactions between tokens. The Sandbox and Polygon teams are currently working on a custom bridge to make all tokens within The Sandbox available on Polygon.

The SAND Foundation

The Sandbox team started the SAND Foundation to support the ecosystem and allocate grants to artists, game developers, and individuals who produce in-game content. Currently, all $SAND transactions incur a 2.5% transaction fee that is allocated to the Foundation Fund.

LAND primary sales  – which accrue as revenue to The Sandbox (a subsidiary company of Animoca Brands – generated $12 million in Q4’21. Meanwhile, both The Sandbox company and The Sandbox Foundation take a 2.5% on secondary sales which resulted in $7 million in revenue in Q4 for each organization. Primary sales revenue will eventually end when all LAND is sold, making secondary sales royalty revenue (on LAND and ASSETS) a key revenue source for the SAND Foundation.

Roadmap

Looking ahead towards the first quarter of 2022, The Sandbox has a few notable developments.

The Sandbox DAO

While not yet deployed, The Sandbox DAO will be able to vote on Foundation grants as well as make decisions on certain game parameters. The Sandbox DAO – set to launch in Q1 of 2022 – will be governed by both SAND token holders and asset owners (e.g. LAND).

Continued LAND Distribution

The gradual distribution of LAND will continue through the first quarter of 2022. This will be coupled with more locations in The Sandbox Metaverse opening with various experiences available to players.

Launch of Public In-game Experiences

In-game experiences – activities for players – are core to growing The Sandbox userbase. Throughout the next two quarters, The Sandbox has planned a variety of experiences including virtual concerts – from LAND owners like Snoop Dogg and Deadmau5 – as well as the launch of games based on licensed intellectual property such as The Walking Dead.

Closing Summary

The Sandbox recorded a record quarter in secondary LAND sales and Foundation revenue. Additionally, it expanded its total buyer base and released a substantial number of new LAND parcels for purchase on the open market. The Sandbox still remains fairly concentrated in LAND ownership, but with 38% of the total LAND parcels yet to be distributed The Sandbox will hopefully see expand its LAND ownership population as the company continues to gradually auction LANDs.

Most importantly, The Sandbox launched its Alpha game to several thousand players along with a myriad of new NFTs including its own NFT avatar collection. As The Sandbox endeavors to create a virtual world populated with people and experiences, the team has various Q1 in-world events planned as well as the upcoming launch of The Sandbox DAO.

“Gentlemen, there’s only two ways I know of to make money: bundling and unbundling.”

Jim Barksdale, formerly of Andreeson Horowitz

  
Aggregating over 188 sources of liquidity across 7 supported blockchains, with volumes greater than 134 billion USD, and over 1.6 million users, few DeFi projects epitomize Barksdale’s famous proclamation as much as the 1inch Network. In December 2021, 1inch successfully raised 175 million USD in a Series B, valuing the network at around $2.25 billion, led by Amber Group. The raise is aimed at navigating the regulatory space in Europe and the US, building new 1inch protocols, expanding the utility of the 1INCH token and scaling up the contributor team.

In an increasingly fragmented DEX landscape with a wide array of chains, sidechains, rollups and their corresponding fee structures, liquidity and slippage, the 1inch aggregator offers a single interface that automatically finds the best price for a given trading pair across multiple sources of liquidity. But it is more than just a comparison shopping engine. The 1inch ecosystem is composed of:

The 1inch Wallet
The 1inch API
The 1inch Aggregation Protocol (DEX aggregator)
The 1inch Limit Order Protocol
The 1inch DAO
The 1inch Foundation

2021 was a busy year for the 1inch Network, with a flurry of innovations aimed at improving the DeFi user experience. Let’s break it down.

Bundling DEXs for Fun and Profit

At the heart of the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is Pathfinder - a routing algorithm that finds the most efficient path for a token swap, splitting the transaction into multiple sub-transactions across different protocols and even different order depths within protocols to give you the best rate. The latest version of the protocol enhances an already long list of optimizations with a range of innovations.

Beyond optimizing swap rates, Pathfinder can also reduce the probability of failed transactions thanks to its partial and dynamic fill mechanism. When a user submits a swap, Pathfinder first splits it between multiple liquidity sources. If during the process the rate on one protocol changes unfavorably, that particular branch of the route can be canceled, and only the favorable branches fulfilled. Further, dynamic fills will even allow the amount from the unfavorable branch to be redistributed across favorable branches, and the swap can be fully completed at the rate advertised in the interface. Users can also choose to optimize for the best rate or the lowest gas fee (up to 40%) - causing Pathfinder to modify its routing accordingly. All of these options can easily be toggled from the swap interface.

With code optimizations in the latest V3 version of the 1inch Aggregation Protocol, 1inch has become one of the most efficient decentralized swap solutions.

Since late 2020, the protocol can also utilize collateral tokens in its routing, such as those minted on Aave and Compound. Such tokens need to be packed or unpacked to be used in a route - and this is done automatically by 1inch for the user, under the hood.

Bundling is one of the oldest business models on the internet, and the 1inch contributors team has demonstrated exceptional execution skills in building out their business. Few projects can claim the laundry list of both liquidity sources and optimizations that 1inch offers through its single interface, resulting in a healthy order flow across all the platforms 1inch operates on.

User growth has also been rapid, with returning users being roughly matched by new users month-on-month.

Unbundling the 1inch AMM - Zero-Fee Limit Orders

1inch also offers its own centralized swap offering with a zero-fee limit order functionality. Most AMMs today offer only market orders which means that once the user places the order, it is executed immediately at the available market price. A limit order is a standing order to execute a swap only when the market reaches a predetermined price or better - typically used by more advanced traders who are able to analyze the market and assess the probability of reaching the limit price.

When a user places a limit order, it is added to a centralized database managed by 1inch. These orders can then be filled by any other user, including CEXs and the orders created by Pathfinder in the aggregation protocol. Takers of limit orders cover the gas costs in addition to the trade’s value, which means this is a zero-fee order for the user. The implementation also allows dynamic pricing, conditional offers where users set conditions for execution and Request for Quote (RFQ) offers for specific order sizes.

This functionality unlocks a host of features. Stop-loss orders, which automatically close when the price limit is reached, trailing stop orders, where the limit is set to ‘trail’ the market price by a fixed amount if it rises, and remain unchanged if the price drops, and auctions such as Maker DAO auctions where the price is dynamically set according to the best bids for a specific order size.

The version 2 of the 1inch Limit Order Protocol also facilitates gasless limit orders for ETH, enabling users with zero ETH balances to swap supported tokens. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for new/first-time users. Other improvements include DAI-like permits extended to more tokens, optimized RFQs and others.

Unbundling specific functionalities (order types in AMMs) and building on them to offer a unique selling proposition is another tried-and-tested business model that 1inch has executed well on, with Ethereum volumes projected to cross 800 million in January 2022.

Unbundling Liquidity with the 1inch Liquidity Protocol

You can earn tokens by participating in 1inch liquidity mining programs and locking LP tokens in pools. While this may seem like any generic AMM, 1inch has an innovation to offer here as well: virtual rates, which are a form of protection against ‘front-running’ attacks.

Front-runners (miners or bots, primarily) observe transactions that are broadcast by a protocol, and insert their own transactions before they are finalized for profit. In AMMs, when a user swaps token A for token B, the amount of token B decreases in the pool compared to token A, becoming more expensive against A. A front-runner can exploit this to change the exchange rate before the user’s transaction by inserting a similar swap before the user in the next block. The two trades execute, and the price for B availed by the front runner is now guaranteed to be less than that after the user’s trade, as both trades successively increase the price of B. This allows them to then sell B back to the pool, with a profit in token A. Sandwiching ‘true’ swaps with such transactions repeatedly can result in large profits for front-runners. The user ends up with a higher rate for B since the front-runner pushed the price up by inserting their swap before the users trade.

Virtual Rates discourage front-runners from such attacks on 1inch liquidity pools. Following a swap, the swap rate changes only for further swaps in the same direction. For swaps in the opposite direction following such a trade, the rate is a virtual rate that matches the previous swap, as opposed to reflecting the true rate dictated by relative volumes of the assets - preventing front-runners from driving the price up and then profiting from the reverse swap. The virtual rate is in effect for a ‘decay period’ following a successful swap, is governed by 1inch DAO participants, and can be set from 1 minute to 5 minutes through direct governance actions.

The 1inch DAO

1INCH token holders can vote on protocol parameters and governance proposals by staking their 1INCH tokens in the governance protocol. The DAO is being implemented in two phases, the first of which kicked off in December 2020. In this phase, the 1inch Foundation distributed 1INCH tokens to community members through ‘incentivization activities’ according to a lockup release schedule. The initial, core community is expected to implement DAO-based governance in an efficient manner while the protocol governance process is stabilized.

The second phase is now underway, which will enable full-fledged control over extended governance mechanisms, and a treasury - as governed by this 1IP. Voting power is bestowed by holding st1INCH (non-transferable ERC-20 tokens representing 1INCH tokens staked in the protocol’s governance contract), and v1INCH (representing backer/advisors/core contributor 1INCH tokens locked in the vesting contract) which have 1/5th the voting power of st1INCH tokens. Both of these can delegate their voting weight to other addresses.

Currently, one address belonging to Binance has around 10% of the voting power, with the next highest being around 6%, as declared on the governance page.

This concentration of power is due to the 1INCH staking pool on Binance, and is not an individual whale holding 1INCH tokens. The 1inch team is waiting for community contributions and other categories to catch up with the core contributors and have a more even distribution - taking us to the next topic, the 1INCH token.  

The 1INCH Token

The 1INCH token has two uses: as a utility token, 1INCH is used in the liquidity protocol to achieve high efficiency routing. As a governance token, stakers of the token will be able to govern the protocol.

The 1inch community will hold 30% of the total supply of tokens, which means that after the vesting period, the majority of the voting power still lies in the hands of the core team, backers and investors. 8% of the 14.5% given to the Network Growth Fund was given to investors in the latest funding round.

The 1inch Foundation

The 1INCH token is issued by the 1inch Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to fostering the 1inch Network and community. It does so by engaging early adopters and growing the population of users staking 1INCH for governance, issuing grants to developers building on the 1inch protocols and yield farming initiatives designed to incentivize liquidity provision across the ecosystem.

Competition

1inch is the dominant DEX aggregator on Ethereum, with more than $130 billion of volume. On both Ethereum and Polygon, 1inch is locked in a battle for supremacy with the 0x protocol (Matcha is the 0x aggregator Dapp).

Ultimately, this is a game of bundling execution, which will be won on the parameters of fees, liquidity, availability of trading pairs, and importantly, integration of other Dapps and Protocols. Within this design space, some tradeoffs are possible. Aggregation can happen not only at the DEX/Dapp level, but also the network level. Since the competitors are essentially aggregating the same DEX’s and Dapps across chains (at least eventually), this space is ripe for commoditization, with those attracting the most liquidity and offering the lowest fees winning out. Execution and speed of adoption and expansion will be the key drivers for success, and 1inch is well placed to remain dominant in this space for the time being.

The Way Forward

1inch has demonstrated remarkable ability to extract capital efficiency out of the DEX ecosystem, and great execution both in terms of user acquisition as well as fund-raising. The rise of the alternate L1s, however, opens up a new horizon for growth, in two dimensions. The first is merely expanding the list of available DEXs and trading pairs. Indeed, 1inch has just expanded into the Avalanche and Gnosis chains in 2022. The other, more complex path is through cross chain swaps. One example is simply to incorporate multiple chains and L2’s within the pathfinding algorithm. Another example is cross-chain staking - where a user can buy a token through 1inch in one chain, and earn staking rewards from another. Technical concerns from Vitalik Buterin notwithstanding, the multi-chain universe represents a new frontier for 1inch to take their bundling and unbundling prowess to new heights.

Sector Returns

For the first time in over one month of Weekly Recaps, all sectors covered have finished with double digit positive returns. The Gaming sector, which has been one of the worst performers the past five weeks has finally set itself apart, bringing in the highest returns for the week with 26.94%. Even though the DeFi sector took the last spot, it brought an impressive 11.44% return.

Top Assets

Top Assets was the second best performing sector of the week with Ripple (XRP) leading the group, finishing the week with a massive 45.4% gain. The driver for XRP’s substantial outperformance compared to other assets in the sector could be attributed to positive sentiment related to the blockchain-based payments firm’s recent court case news. Avalanche (AVAX) took the second spot with a similarly impressive return of 31.0%. Unlike the top two performing assets of the sector, the rest of the assets traded with high synchrony and ended the week with returns ranging from 19.6% to 12.0%., Solana (SOL) was the laggard of the group.

DeFi Assets

Although DeFi was the least performing sector, it was by no means unimpressive. The sector saw a $7 billion influx of fresh TVL since last week, bouncing from the $200 billion support line. Thorchain’s RUNE was the best performer of the week, returning a 24.2% gain, closely followed by Aave (AAVE) with 23.0%. PancakeSwap performed the worst of the pack with a 4.2% return.

Smart Contract Platforms

Avalanche (AVAX) demonstrated resilience as most of the Smart Contract Platform assets experienced a mild drawdown mid week, AVAX continued its “up and to the right” trajectory allowing it to secure the top performer position for the week. The alternate Layer-1 assets returned a 31.0% gain on the week while the next best performer, Ethereum (ETH) was more than 10% away with a 19.5% return. Algorand returned 11.4% for the week, making it the least underperformer of the group.

Currencies

Amongst the Currencies sector, Ripple (XRP) was the outperformer of the week by a large margin. While the rest of the assets were losing upward momentum, XRP managed to maintain its strength, breaking away from the pack mid week. It closed the week with a 45.4% return while the second spot was taken by Monero (XMR) with a 28.5% return. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) performed the least in the group, with weekly returns of 15.6% and 12.8%, respectively.

Web3

Arweave (AR) was the Web3 sector leader for this week. The data storage protocol brought in a 23.5% return this week marking the first time the protocol claims the best performing asset of the sector since bringing back Weekly Recaps. Basic Attention Token (BAT) was on track to end the week as the worst performer but was able to regain territory allowing it to secure the second to last position with a 15.0%. Ultimately Stacks (STX) took the last spot with a 14.1% gain.

Gaming

Gaming had an impressive week, taking the spot as the top performing sector. Leading the pack with the highest return was Axie Infinity (AXS) which brought in a 36.0% gain. Next up was Chiliz (CHZ) returning 34.5% for the week. Out of the top 10 gaming assets by market capitalization, Yield Guild Games (YGG) was the only one not to finish the week with a 20%+ gain, returning 10.1%.

9511e41f-bf3c-40be-84bb-e297012c9d5a,FRAX: A Fractional-Algorithmic Stablecoin,"The following report was commissioned by FRAX, a member of <a href=""https://messari.io/hub"">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.

MakerDAO created one of the first and arguably the most successful stablecoin, DAI (which is pegged to the USD 1:1). Maker’s DAI launched in 2017 and has been used throughout the DeFi ecosystem for lending, borrowing, and treasury reserves. DAI is created when collateral is placed into the Maker smart contract. To add a layer of stability, Maker requires that DAI is overcollateralized, but this also makes their stablecoin more capital inefficient. DAI, USDT, and USDC became some of the more prevalent stablecoins in the DeFi landscape throughout 2018-2020 as users and protocols leveraged these stablecoins to earn yield and expand their digital product offerings to users. USDC has inherent centralization risks since it’s reliant upon the USD and Maker’s DAI is heavily collateralized by USDC. Regardless, Maker’s DAI and usage attracted the attention of others in the industry as to the necessity and growth potential of stablecoins in the web3 ecosystem.

Until FRAX launched on Ethereum mainnet on 21 December 2020, stablecoins had either been fully backed by collateral (e.g. DAI) or entirely algorithmic (no collateral backing). Frax Finance was first announced in May 2019 (known then as Decentral Bank) as a fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. The project was founded by Sam Kazemian, Jason Huan, and Travis Moore. Frax was created to be the “world’s first decentralized stablecoin with parts of its supply collateralized and parts algorithmic stabilized.”

Frax is the first stablecoin protocol to implement design principles from both fully collateralized (e.g. Maker Protocol) and fully algorithmic stablecoins to create a new scalable, trustless, stable on-chain money (FRAX Docs). FRAX is pegged 1:1 to USD, which means it attempts to maintain 1 FRAX = 1 USD$.

The growth of FRAX has been impressive with massive adoption and system-wide traction occurring in Q4 2021 with the launch of Frax v2. As of January 25, the Frax treasury is earning an average of ~$500K income daily (~$180M annualized) through the AMOs, Algorithmic Market Operations Controllers, which the team launched in early Q4 2021. Additionally, the FRAX supply has climbed from under $500M FRAX to an incredible $2.6B FRAX in this same time period.

Understanding Frax Protocol

At genesis, FRAX was 100% collateralized, meaning that minting FRAX only requires placing collateral into the minting contract. Today, Frax is operating in the fractional collateral phase, which means to mint FRAX requires placing the appropriate collateral and FXS into the Frax protocol. While the protocol is designed to accept any type of cryptocurrency as collateral, Frax will mainly accept on-chain stablecoins to keep volatility low so that FRAX can transition to higher algorithmic ratios smoothly. As FRAX gains traction and the system’s velocity increases, it could become easier and safer to include more volatile cryptocurrencies such as ETH and wrapped BTC into future pools.

The Frax protocol implements a two token system design: a stablecoin, FRAX, and a governance token, FXS. The two token system allows for FRAX to be backed by both collateral and an algorithm (burning and redeeming of FXS). FRAX is minted when collateral and FXS are deposited into the Frax protocol contract. The amount of collateral needed to be deposited to mint 1 FRAX is determined by the collateralization ratio. The Frax collateralization ratio determines the ratio between collateral and algorithm that makes up the $1 FRAX value.

For example, let’s assume the collateralization ratio is 80%. This means that 80% of 1 FRAX is backed by collateral, like USDC, and 20% is backed by the algorithm that manages FXS supply. For both minting and redemption purposes, the protocol obeys the collateralization ratio, guaranteeing that 1 FRAX is backed by $1 of value.

Peg stability is a crucial component for any stablecoin. FRAX maintains its USD 1:1 peg through deep liquidity pools. One such pool, also the largest liquidity pool, is on Curve Finance in FRAX3CRV. As of writing, the FRAX3CRV pool holds approximately 1.3B FRAX and this deep FRAX liquidity enables FRAX to be traded and swapped for other stablecoins with low or no slippage. The Curve AMO, implemented as part of Frax v2, furthers the stability of FRAX by automatically supplying excess collateral plus FRAX from the Frax protocol to the FRAX3CRV pool to ensure this deep liquidity remains (more on this below in the AMO section).

The price of FRAX, FXS, and collateral are calculated using a time-weighted average of the Uniswap pair price and the ETH:USD Chainlink oracle. The Chainlink oracle allows the protocol to get the true price of USD instead of an average of stablecoin pools on Uniswap. This allows FRAX to stay stable against the dollar itself which would provide greater resiliency instead of using a weighted average of existing stablecoins only.

Frax is an agnostic protocol and allows the market to determine the collateralization ratio that it will settle on long term. The Frax protocol does not make any assumptions about what collateralization ratio the market will tolerate. Instead, Frax allows for the ratio to fluctuate and the market determines what collateral ratio the market prices FRAX at $1.

Tokenomics and Value Accrual

The FXS supply has been initially set to 100 million tokens at genesis. As more FRAX is used in DeFi ecosystems, this drives value to the FXS holders because minting FRAX requires burning FXS (thus decreasing FXS supply, and increasing value to FXS holders). As the value of FXS goes up, the price stability of FRAX increases creating a positive feedback loop for all those who are lending or borrowing FRAX to do DeFi or other digital economic transactions.

Frax Finance also allows investors to become liquidity providers by bonding FRAX/FXS or FXS/ETH on Uniswap, which generates fee revenue for the liquidity providers on trades and swaps.

The protocol has also implemented the vote escrowed (ve) governance token model. This model is generally analogous to the well known veCRV framework, with slight variations for the Frax protocol (more on this below). In addition, Frax has developed a unique protocol feature called algorithmic market operations modules, or AMO. These are discussed in further detail below, but this mechanism further drives value back to holders of FXS.

Performance upgrades: veFXS and Frax v2 AMOs

veFXS and cvxFXS

Shortly after the project launched in 2020, FXS holders were allowed to lock up their FXS tokens to generate veFXS (voting escrow FXS) and earn special boost, governance rights, and AMO (Algorithmic Market Operations Controller) profits. The vote escrow, or “ve”, mechanism has been popular across several DeFi protocols. FXS holders are eligible to lockup their FXS tokens for up to four years. The longer the FXS tokens are locked, the more bonuses awarded to the veFXS holders. It should be noted that the veFXS tokens are non-transferable.

Additionally, veFXS holders are also able to participate in Frax gauges and influencing or directing FXS to different FRAX gauges - a similar mechanism that was established by the Curve protocol and it’s gauge system. veFXS holders are eligible to direct FXS to one or multiple Frax gauges of their choosing. Once all of the FXS has been emitted, the gauges will turn to managing FRAX stablecoin expansion to continue to reward liquidity providers.

Recently, Convex has partnered with Frax protocol to further align the two protocols' incentive programs, specifically around locking veFXS into the CVX protocol. Before diving into this partnership, it’s important to understand Convex’ place in the DeFi ecosystem.

Convex was launched in May 2021 as a platform intended to boost CRV rewards and simplify staking CRV for liquidity providers and stakers by creating an access point to CRV benefits through its native CVX token. Thus, as soon as Convex was launched it began actively acquiring the CRV and veCRV tokens. By early summer 2021, it became the largest holder of veCRV tokens in what’s been dubbed the Curve Wars. Curve Finance rewards liquidity providers with CRV tokens, which allows governance rights on which protocols’ pools are funded with CRV rewards and fee sharing. By the end of 2021, Convex Finance has solidified its lead role as the main shareholder of Curve governance.

With Convex as the main holder of veCRV tokens, DeFi protocols have begun to acquire and partner with Convex as a way to access the governance rights and benefits allocated to veCRV holders (recall veCRV holders dictate which Curve pools are rewarded with CRV emissions every 10 days).

Back to Frax and Convex. Frax holds 19% of CVX giving them substantial governance power in the Convex protocol, which can be thought of as a proxy for veCRV governance power and directing future CRV rewards.

The Frax and Convex partnership comes with added benefits to the veFXS holders. veFXS holders are able to lock their veCVX into the Convex protocol in return for cvxFXS. This deposited veFXS will be irreversible and locked forever. All cvxFXS holders will be rewarded with a future FPI (Frax Price Index) token airdrop. In the future, cvxFXS/FXS bonding pair will be created so that protocols and users may exit their cvxFXS position. As of writing, cvxFXS staking and rewards are still being developed and are not finalized yet.

Frax v2: AMOs

Frax v2 launched the algorithmic market operations modules, or AMO. An AMO creates smoother operations for Frax by automating the movement of FRAX and its collateral across the DeFi ecosystem. The Frax AMOs further enable FRAX growth by leveraging Frax’s assets in a capital efficient way by programmatically moving collateral and/or FRAX to capital efficient locations depending on the collateral ratio. Frax has implemented several key AMOs: FXS 1559, Collateral Investor, Curve AMO, Uniswap v3, and FRAX lending.

FXS1559 is an in-protocol rule that all AMOs must utilize. FXS1559 calculates all excess value in the Frax system above the collateral ratio and uses this value to buy FXS for burning. Until October 2021, FXS1559 stated that 50% of value would be used to buy then burn FXS (creating value for FXS holders by decreasing supply) and 50% was given directly to veFXS holders. In October 2021, Frax passed a <a href=""https://messari.io/governor/proposal/d8780def-fcb1-404e-a570-e12ba26a5610"">proposal</a> to give 100% of AMO revenues and profits to veFXS holders. This change further incentives FXS holders to lock their FXS in the Frax protocol as veFXS rather than hold FXS.

The Collateral Investor AMO puts idle USDC collateral from the Frax treasury to work across several DeFi protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Yearn. This AMO will loan out or reclaim collateral automatically as the collateral ratio changes. As the collateral ratio lowers and more of FRAX is backed algorithmically, the Collateral Investor AMO will automatically send collateral to the aforementioned protocols to generate additional yield on its USDC for veFXS holders. If the collateral ratio rises and more collateral is required to back FRAX, the Collateral Investor AMO will work in reverse and pull collateral back to the Frax treasury in accordance with the collateral ratio that the market deems necessary to keep confidence in Frax. Since implementation, the Collateral Investor has accrued $63.4M profits for veFXS holders.

The Curve AMO moves idle USDC collateral and/or new FRAX to the FRAX3CRV Curvel pool to create more liquidity and tighten the FRAX peg. The FRAX3CRV pool will earn Curve trading fees, CRV, and other LP rewards (by loaning out the CRV LPs to Yearn, StakeDAO, and Convex). The trading fees and LP rewards will be used to reward veFXS holders, while the CRV rewards will be used to boost the FRAX3CRV pool rewards. Similar to the Collateral Investor AMO, as the collateral ratio changes, FRAX then USDC will be added (collateral ratio lowers) or removed (collateral ratio rises) from the FRAX3CRV pool to make sure that FRAX is appropriately backed by the right percentage of collateral within the FRAX treasury.

The Uniswap v3 AMO (or Liquidity AMO) puts FRAX and idle collateral to work by providing liquidity Uniswap v3. This provides liquidity for other stablecoins to be traded and swapped for FRAX. Since the AMO is able enter any position on Uniswap v3 and mint FRAX against it, the Uniswap v3 AMO allows for expansion to other stablecoins and later more volatile collateral that is on Uniswap v3. The trading fees generated from the liquidity provided are brought back to reward veFXS holders. As with the other AMOs, as the collateral ratio changes, FRAX and collateral can be added or withdrawn from it’s LP position on Uniswap v3.

The FRAX Lending AMO allows for FRAX to be minted into money markets such as Aave to allow anyone to borrow FRAX by paying interest instead of the base minting mechanism. The collateral provided in these protocols treasuries would back the FRAX minted. The mechanism used here is very similar to Maker’s D3M feature, where DAI supply is expanded/contracted from a lending market based on the current borrowing demand. This AMO creates risk as FRAX is backed by collateral held by other protocols, but the protocol is able to moderate this risk by controlling the amount allowed to be minted directly into money markets.

Of these AMOs, Collateral Investor AMO brings in the majority of the profits for Frax Finance. As seen in the graph below, the Collateral Investor has accrued profits worth ~$75M since being implemented in October 2021.

Currently, there are other AMOs in the works, such as Collateral Hedge and a Tornado Cash integration. These too will follow the same principles that all AMOs comply with. AMOs will likely continue to be proposed and implemented as FRAX is expanded and leveraged as a stablecoin in more DeFi protocols.

Market Overview

Frax Finance operates in the stablecoin market, which has largely been dominated by fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. Algorithmic flavors of stablecoins have recently seen tremendous growth, specifically FRAX whose market cap has grown nearly 530% since October 2021. This trend will likely continue as the wider ecosystem seeks liquidity to match its overall growth, and algorithmic stablecoins such as FRAX can leverage their capital efficient AMOs to fill this gap.

However, FRAX is not the only algorithmic stablecoin seeking to expand it’s supply in the ecosystem and DeFi space. Stablecoins like FEI and UST have both seen rapid growth as of late, with UST hovering around $10.6B in market cap and FEI seeing ~50% growth in its market cap over the past quarter (Q4 2021). Developments and growth are happening at a breakneck pace in stablecoins. One example would be the Fei and Rari protocols merger. With this merger, Fei will look to capitalize on integrating its stablecoin FEI further into DeFi by leveraging Rari’s lending markets.

It’s unlikely the market has reached a state of winner-take-all dynamics regarding algorithmic stablecoins. Frax and other similar stablecoin protocols will likely continue to grow together as the overall stablecoin market and DeFi products grow. From a systemic perspective, FRAX has done a remarkable job holding its peg, and exhibiting the powerful efficiencies of an algorithmic stablecoin. Now that supply has grown and deep FRAX liquidity exists, it would seemingly require a catastrophic (ecosystem-wide) event to destabilize it. This risk exists for FRAX as well as the other, robust stablecoins.

Roadmap and other partnerships

The multichain universe

Frax is built to be interoperable across all chains. There is not an independent Frax implementation for each chain. For this reason, the protocol has a bridging system that allows it to maintain a tight peg and fungibility. Importantly, the AMO functions and FRAX gauges can be deployed across different chains, allowing for FRAX expansion into new and growing markets and chains.

As stated by the Frax team: “The Frax Protocol is a multichain protocol with global state consistent across all deployments. FRAX + FXS tokens are a single distribution across all networks.” Each blockchain has one canonical FRAX and one canonical FXS contract that are referred to as ""FRAX'' and ""FXS"". These tokens are what AMOs expand or contract and users can mint or redeem.

FPI: Frax Price Index token

On 1 January 2022, Sam tweeted that the Frax team has been and is working on the Frax Price Index ($FPI). This would enable decentralized applications to reference $FPI as an algostable peg. Not much has been said or revealed yet, however, cvxFXS holders will be rewarded a FPI airdrop.

Other recent partnerships: OlympusDAO & Ondo Finance

There have been other partnerships, such as a token swap between OlympusDAO and Frax Finance (OHM  FRAX) to “further incentivize team] collaboration.” The OlympusDAO team has been actively building a treasury filled with DeFi tokens and stablecoins, which can be bonded to their OHM token. This has allowed OlympusDAO to create an entire marketplace for [protocol owned liquidity.

Another recent partnership is between Ondo Finance and Frax Finance. This partnership aims to create a product that Ondo will market and sell called “Frax-as-a-Service” or FaaS. The idea is that a new protocol will be able to deposit their native token into an Ondo vault and Frax and Ondo will match the protocol’s deposited amount with equal amounts of FRAX, creating a liquidity pair. This enables the protocol to immediately have liquidity for their token for users and protocols to onboard and offboard without needing to set up liquidity mining programs. As a participating party, Frax Finance will receive 5% APR on the liquidity it provides.

Conclusion

Frax allows for the market to determine the collateralization ratio that it is comfortable with for $1 FRAX. As demand for FRAX increases, the veFXS holders will benefit as rewards and profits from the AMOs implemented to leverage idle collateral. While there are risks with FRAX and any token within the web3 finance space to consider, the Frax protocol experiment, a fractional-algorithmic stablecoin, has proven incredibly exciting and innovative.

Having multiple stablecoins (DAI, FRAX, MIM, UST, etc.) with different designs is a value-add to the crypto and web3 ecosystem as it derisks the blockchain ecosystems. FRAX and FXS are built with a long-term mindset and vision to have FRAX integrating into critical DeFi protocols. The novel fractional-algorithmic stablecoin design of FRAX allows for capital efficient stablecoin creation and allocation, and as the overall market continues expansion, FRAX should be well positioned to further this growth.

We all know Yearn. It’s the set-it-and-forget-it yield aggregator running on top of DeFi’s yield-generating protocols like Compound, Aave, Curve, and Convex. Users can passively earn with the click of a button. Within Yearn’s Vaults, strategists continually compete to write the top yield-earning strategies as they are rewarded 50% of the revenue. Over time, the protocol has become synonymous with yield and has garnered an industry reputation as a leading risk-minimized yield source.

But what do we not know about Yearn? What’s under the covers? Sure it’s grown 11x in terms of TVL since the start of 2021, but where is this growth coming from? It’s an important question to understand as a token investment is, in traditional theory, valued at nothing more than the discounted value of future cash flows. And future growth is defined at the margin - so who is the marginal depositor for Yearn?

Yearn’s Anatomy

Let’s first break down Yearn’s multiple products.

Vaults: The flagship protocol used by the majority of users, Vaults account for 67% of Yearn’s TVL. Users deposit into a vault which is defined per asset and the underlying yield strategies are executed to deploy the capital. As the first iteration, V1 vaults were limited to single strategies and have since been deprecated. V2 launched at the turn of the year and offers more complex yield aggregation as vaults can be powered by multiple yield strategies.
Earn: Similar in nature to vaults but even more simple. It originally focused on stable assets which users could deposit and underneath the assets are shifted between money market protocols depending on which offers the highest yield.
Iron Bank (IB): IB is a money market protocol focused on servicing users and protocols. Users are able to deposit approved assets as collateral to earn yield from borrowers or borrow other assets themselves. Protocol users can be whitelisted in order to facilitate under-collateralized borrowing.
Special: This is a catch-all for non-core businesses. It accounts for yGov and yveCurve TVL.

TVL grew significantly from March through May adding over $4B in TVL. Of the new TVL, 68% or $2.8B came from the new V2 Vaults - by far the majority. However, since May, the V2 vaults have been largely flat up until mid-September where Vault TVL again began its upward climb growing over 31% into mid-October.

Here we have two distinct periods of growth in the V2 vaults. One at the beginning of the year from roughly March through May, and another recent move starting in mid-September. As anyone in crypto can surely tell you, these two periods are both times of significant price appreciation in ETH and BTC; begging the question - is this growth due to organic, new deposits or simply underlying price appreciation?

Yearn has distinct vaults for each asset it supports. 7 vaults hold over $100M in deposits and account for over 76% of the V2 vault TVL. Assets supported in these vaults include the top stablecoins like USDC, DAI, USDT, and the top market cap tokens ETH and staked ETH as well as WBTC. Splitting these vaults out between stable assets and volatile assets and focusing on the raw token counts shows where deposits are organically increasing irrespective of price.

Looking at the first phase of V2 growth from March to June, both deposits of stablecoins and volatile assets increased significantly. Stables grew nearly 5x during this time and added nearly $1B in new TVL. ETH and stETH (yvCurve-stETH) deposits grew nearly 3x and added $400k in new TVL.

The second period of growth is noticeably different. Stablecoin token counts in vaults actually declined from mid-September to mid-October while there has been a sharp increase in new token deposits in the ETH denominated vaults - particularly the yvCurve-stETH vault. Over $670M (170k ETH) has been added to the stETH vault between September 15th and October 15th. 6x growth in 30 days.

Breaking out TVL across the top V2 vaults (vaults over $100M in TVL which collectively account for over 76% of the V2 TVL), the recent growth period trend is clear. USDC TVL has decreased 9% over the last 90 days. DAI has modestly increased 2%. ETH and stETH TVL, however, are up over 118% and 109%, respectively, across the same timeframe.

So there we have it. Two distinct periods of growth for Yearn V2 vaults with different underlying drivers - Phase 1 was heavily influenced by stablecoin deposits while Phase 2 was exclusively ETH and stETH driven. However, despite differences in sources of growth, both phases share one distinctive quality - the sharpness of the growth.

Stablecoin deposits went nearly vertical across April. stETH and ETH have been doing the same since mid-September. With such concentrated, rapid growth drivers, another question is raised - are numerous new depositors coming in, or is this the result of a few, large depositors?

To understand the wealth distribution in the top V2 vaults, various cohorts of depositors are broken out into buckets by how much TVL is deposited from the unique address. For example, depositors contributing between $1 and $100k is one bucket, between $100k and $500k another, $500k to $1M, and so forth. Doing so reveals a distinct relationship between the types of depositors Yearn has in its V2 vaults: wealth concentration.

Despite having over 6,220 active depositors in the top V2 vaults, $2.0B or 76% of the top V2 vault TVL comes from the 30 addresses depositing over $10M. $10M being deposited from a single address isn’t neighbor-nextdoor money, it’s protocol money.

$1.5B or 57% of all the TVL in the top seven V2 Vaults come from 18 identified partner protocol integrations. External protocol partners are directing significant TVL towards Yearn’s vaults in order to repurpose the generated yield as a design component in their protocols.

Alchemix is the largest Yearn depositor contributing nearly $600M in TVL across the yvDAI and yvWETH vaults. Alone it contributes over 76% of the DAI TVL and 44% of the yvWETH TVL.<a href=""https://messari.io/article/alchemix-bringing-future-yields-to-the-present"">Alchemix</a> protocol takes collateral deposits which are by and large deposited into Yearn’s yield bearing vaults. Yield generated on this collateral is automatically applied as payments to a user’s outstanding loan debt in Alchemix.

Sushi’s BentoBox is the second-largest protocol contributor with over $583M deposited across the yvUSDC, yvUSDT, yvWETH, and yvCurve-stETH vaults. BentoBox is a protocol under the Sushi umbrella that acts as a base-layer protocol for other protocols to build on top of. Its key feature is to allocate idle deposits towards yield-bearing strategies - one of which is Yearn Vaults. BentoBox is the largest depositor in the yvUSDC vault, contributes a third of the yvWETH TVL, and nearly half of the $674M TVL in the yvCurve-stETH. The ETH and stETH deposits are most notable as they can be largely tied to one meteoric protocol building on top of the BentoBox app Kashi - Abracadabra. Both yvWETH and yvSTETH are two of the top three collateral assets utilized in Abracadabra to back its stablecoin, MIM.

In fact, Abracadabra (via Sushi’s BentoBox) and Alchemix play significant parts in the two phases of growth identified previously. Alchemix, initially launched in March with its DAI vault, is largely responsible for the massive expansion of DAI in Yearn during the first period of growth. Abracadabra has increased its TVL by 5x from mid-September and is the driving factor for the second phase of Yearn’s growth which is largely made up of new deposits of stETH and ETH.

Another linkage between these two protocols is their association with the<a href=""https://messari.io/article/beyond-defi-2-0-what-is-driving-defi-s-current-innovation"">DeFi 2.0 </a>narrative. It’s important to understand the mechanisms driving this narrative in order to understand how Yearn is growing its influence across the ecosystem.

Outside of the protocol-controlled value (PCV) features, protocols that are commonly associated with the DeFi 2.0 narrative largely utilize Yearn’s yield-bearing vault tokens (yvTokens) as a design aspect to make existing processes more efficient. Abracadabra uses yield-bearing assets to back collateralized debt positions. Alchemix uses Yearn yield to self-repay loans. Frax uses Yearn yield to collateralize its stablecoin. Ribbon uses Yearn yvUSDC as collateral to sell structured option strategies against.

Yearn has effectively grown out of being the peoples’ yield aggregator and moved into the role of being the dominant yield partner for other protocols. One could argue Yearn has found the bulk of its growth and product-market-fit as a Yield-as-a-Service protocol (B2B), not as an end-user protocol (B2C).

This isn’t entirely without design. Back in March, prior to the first growth phase, Yearn announced the Yearnpartnership program in which protocol partners who contribute capital to Yearn vaults can earn back half of the revenue generated (after the strategist 50% revenue).

Success with the partnership program comes down to how Yearn is positioned in the ecosystem. Yearn is able to offer a single, trusted integration point to other protocols for yield so that time is not wasted and integration risk is not introduced managing and maintaining strategies themselves. It serves as a capital allocation protocol fully at the disposal of users and protocols alike. However, Yearn differs in the magnitude of the value provided to the two different parties which is manifested in the sources of Yearn’s growth figures. To users, Yearn and its yield is the end goal. To protocols, yield is a means to an end, a tool utilized in the creation of a new product - something that creates additional value and efficiency.

The Next Phase

Where Yearn grows from here is largely dependent on its V3 UI, multi-chain strategy, and the defensibility of its position.

Yearn’s V3 UI was recently released as a beta in September and introduced a number of key changes focused on improving user experience, scalability, multi-chain adoption, and B2B integrations. The bulk of the updates in the V3 UI are on its back-end architecture. A new SDK is introduced which simplifies data aggregation of on-chain and off-chain data within Yearn. It simplifies the integration process for not just Yearn, but also its partners.

Multichain is a huge benefactor of the new V3 UI architecture. Now architecturally feasible in the back-end, Yearn was able to announce in early October it would be deploying on Fantom followed by numerous other EVM chains (provided they have safe, dependable yield sources).

So far Yearn has been able to defend its position in DeFi as the dominant yield aggregator. This is evidenced by its ability to command an industry-leading 2/20 fee model which has generated the fourth largest DeFi protocol revenue in the last 180 days without any liquidity incentives.

Maintaining its dominant Ethereum position while expanding into leading positions across ecosystems with potentially new yield sources, new protocols partners, and new competitors will be the next question to address for the protocol.","[{'name': 'Dustin Teander', 'url': ''}]",2022-02-08T14:00:00Z,{'name': 'Dustin Teander'},"['Decentralized-Finance', 'Yield-Farming']",https://messari.io/article/yearning-for-yearn
85df39cb-f9d0-4e41-b462-8e5479f25657,From Burning Bridges to Allbridges,"The following report was commissioned by Allbridge, a member of <a href=""https://messari.io/hub"">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.

Scaling and interoperability solutions are the core plumbing of the crypto industry. Today, there are over 100 active public blockchains. Bridges are essential to enable the transfer of assets and information between one chain and another. But before diving into blockchain bridges, why should blockchains be interoperable in the first place? Reviewing some Economics 101 may help clarify.

Consider a simple world of two economies, Belgium and France, that only produce beer and wine, respectively. It is common knowledge that France is better at producing wine than Belgium. The country has the production facilities, labor, expertise, and climate - though the latter might change with global warming. Relative to beer country Belgium, it is not hard to imagine it costs France more to produce beer. In this simple model, both countries specialize in producing one good.

In reality, the French (usually) don’t only want to drink wine. In the absence of trade, they are happy to give up some production of wine to produce beer. The problem is that it would be much more efficient if France could export its excess wine and import beer from Belgium. The same reasoning holds for Belgium as a specialized producer of beer. The optimum is evident: both economies can enjoy more goods for the same amount of resources by engaging in trade.

Trade theory shows us that every economy benefits from trade one way or the other. The same train of thought can be applied to blockchain ecosystems. Blockchains also specialize in unique use cases, target audiences, and geographies. The most critical differences follow from the scalability trilemma coined by Vitalik Buterin. All networks have to make a trade-off between being fully decentralized, secure, or scalable. For example, Ethereum prioritizes decentralization and security over scalability. Solana, on the other hand, optimizes performance at the cost of decentralization. In this example, trade theory shows us we should run compute-intensive applications such as derivatives on Solana and process critical transactions on Ethereum. That is if these blockchains can “trade” information with each other.

The scalability trilemma is exactly why alternative smart contract platforms gained so much traction in 2021. Instead of maximizing Ethereum, users jumped over to different networks for different applications. Over the last year, total value locked (TVL) increased from $18 billion to just shy of $250 billion across Layer-1s and scaling solutions. As the market continues to grow, Ethereum’s dominance may slowly deteriorate over time. Today, Ethereum controls roughly 60% of total assets locked in smart contract platforms. That’s a 30% decline from August 2020 - a clear signal that crypto is moving towards a multi-chain world.

All of these new blockchains need to talk with each other instead of competing in silos, and effective cross-chain connectors are necessary to induce communication across chains. The need for cross-chain communication is where bridges enter the scene. They open up a whole new playing field: they enable users to access new platforms with their assets, protocols to interoperate with each other, and developers to build out new features and products. There is an incredible opportunity in bridging infrastructure, and Allbridge is laying the foundation.

Allbridge

Launched in July 2021, Allbridge is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain bridge with on-chain consensus. The platform provides a simple and reliable way to transfer tokens between various networks. Allbridge is backed by APYSwap Foundation and initially focused on bridging Solana with other chains. It was therefore originally called Solbridge. Realizing it could use its expertise to bridge any network, the project rebranded to Allbridge. The team now aspires to create a decentralized multi-chain hub for bridging assets. To fund these ambitions, Allbridge launched its token ABR on the Boca Chica and Smartpad launchpads in September 2021. The project also recently underwent a rebranding to improve user experience and cater to a broader audience.

Source: Allbridge App

Allbridge bridges tokens across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Layer-2, and non-EVM compatible blockchains and plans to support NFTs in the future. The protocol uses a modular architecture to integrate additional chains more efficiently. The result: the bridge was able to support 47 assets across Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, and six other networks in seven months. Aurora and Harmony are the latest blockchains to be supported on the platform.

A total of $5 billion has been bridged on the platform to date - a 117% increase from the $2.3 billion bridged in October. In December, $231,000 in fees were collected on the platform, and on average, 2,900 transfers were made on Allbridge every day. Solana is the most active network with a 44% share in fees collected. At the time of writing, close to $380 million in assets are locked in its liquidity pools. Those are healthy numbers for any seven-month-old protocol, and clearly, there’s a significant opportunity left as Allbridge continues to integrate new blockchains and tokens.

How Is Allbridge Built?

Allbridge has a very intuitive platform for users. Users connect their wallets and execute a send transaction on source blockchain A and a receive transaction on destination blockchain B. The transfer only takes as long as it takes to transact on the two blockchains. This means that the transfer can be completed almost instantly if the confirmation speed is fast enough.

Source: Documentation

Behind this simple user experience lies an innovative protocol design. Users can make four different transfers on Allbridge:

Send native tokens and receive native tokens: Native tokens are locked on blockchain A and unlocked on blockchain B. This works similar to a DEX with two liquidity pools facilitating a swap.
Send native tokens and receive wrapped tokens: Native tokens are locked in the liquidity pool on blockchain A, and wrapped tokens are minted on blockchain B.
Send wrapped tokens and receive native tokens: Wrapped tokens are burned on blockchain A, and native tokens are unlocked from the liquidity pool on blockchain B.
Send wrapped tokens and receive wrapped tokens: Wrapped tokens are burned on blockchain A, and minted on blockchain B.

Transfers are completed by a series of requests between the user, the smart contracts on both blockchains, and the validators. A detailed walkthrough of all transfers can be found in the documentation.

As an example, transferring native tokens for wrapped tokens, the user sends native tokens to the smart contract on blockchain A. The smart contract locks the tokens and creates a request log when the transaction is completed. Before the user can send the receive transaction to blockchain B, the validators must first check the request log. If the validators conclude the funds are correctly locked on blockchain A, they send a signature to the user, who sends the signature to the smart contract on blockchain B. The smart contract then mints the appropriate amount of wrapped tokens and sends them to the user. The wrapped token tracks the price of the original asset using oracles but is compatible with the other blockchain. This lock-and-mint process ensures a 1:1 relation between the locked and minted tokens across the two chains.

Source: Documentation

Validators play a defining role in Allbridge. Every bridging transaction has to be confirmed by a two-thirds majority of validators. In return, they receive their fair share of the fees when a transaction is signed successfully. To become a validator, one must meet specific technical requirements. These requirements are primarily related to the ability to set up servers and nodes. In addition, validators must stake ABR tokens. These staked funds are slashed in case a validator behaves maliciously. Slashing incentivizes validators to act in the best interest of the protocol.

Unlike most bridging solutions, Allbridge uses an on-chain validator consensus. This means that every validator transaction can be tracked and verified on-chain, which improves transparency for the protocol. A dedicated block explorer will be developed to monitor transfers.

Security

According to PeckShield, bridges were hacked for a record high of $644 million in Q3 2021. This includes the $611 million stolen from Poly Network in what is likely the most significant theft in DeFi history - even though the funds were returned a few weeks later. In addition, the study found that $147 million, or 55% of illicit assets, were cashed out through cross-chain bridges in the first six months of 2021. Clearly, there is a lot of criminal activity in the bridge space. Therefore, the ideal blockchain bridge should not only be interconnected, high-throughput, cost-effective, and trustless but must also be very secure.

The team has expressed several measures to upgrade security, such as ordering additional security audits, implementing a kill switch, and limiting the outbound transactions. In October 2021, the audit performed by blockchain security consultant Hacken found Allbridge’s code to be well-secured.

Tokeneconomics

The Allbridge ecosystem is powered by the ABR and xABR tokens. The tokens are used to pay for fees and staking as follows:

Users are charged a fixed bridge fee of 0.3% for every transfer. These fees are paid in the token that is transferred. Projects must pay a monthly subscription to use the bridge. The subscription fee is paid in ABR. Of all the fees generated on the platform, 80% is swapped to ABR and distributed to stakers. The remainder is distributed to the team.

Stakers can lock ABR on all integrated blockchains. In return, they receive xABR tokens one-for-one, which represent their share in the blockchain staking pool. Stakers earn rewards from fees and incentivization programs. When rewards are added to the staking pool, the number of ABR in the pool increases, and xABR becomes worth more than ABR. The xABR tokens are burned in exchange for ABR when users unstake and thus receive more ABR than they initially locked. This is how stakers can generate yield on Allbridge.

Source: Documentation

In addition to attractive yields, stakers also benefit from dynamic percentage fees. Users that hold xABR on a particular blockchain are charged less for transactions sent from that network. The bridge fees are reduced exponentially. This means that users can enjoy a large reduction in fees by staking only a small amount. At present, as little as 10 xABR reduces the fee from the fixed rate of 0.3% to 0.2%. The bridge fee depends on the user’s pool share and therefore changes dynamically with TVL. The minimum fee is currently set at $0.50. The fee model is designed to incentivize staking and is an important value proposition to users.

A total of 100,000,000 ABR tokens were distributed to the community, APYSwap, team, staking and liquidity pools, incentive programs, and ecosystem DAO. The public sale was held on launchpads Boca Chica and Smartpad in September 2021. There are several categories of recipients for which tokens will be unlocked linearly over a multi-year period and subject to semi-annual or annual cliffs. The initial distribution and unlock schedules were as follows:

Source: Documentation

Are All Bridges Created Equal?

Many developers have realized the opportunity for connectors in the multi-chain world. At the time of writing, there are more than 40 different bridge projects. While they all seek to make the crypto space more interoperable, they are not all created equal. Dmitriy Berenzon best categorized four types of bridges:

Asset-specific: Bridges that provide access to a specific asset from a foreign chain. BTC is the most common asset to be bridged, and BitGo’s Wrapped BTC is the largest bridge of BTC to Ethereum.
Chain-specific: Bridges that connect two different networks. The most popular ones are Layer-2 bridges. For example, Avalanche Bridge allows users to transfer assets from Ethereum to Avalanche and vice versa.
Application-specific: Applications that provide access to two or more blockchains, but only for use within those applications. Examples include Compound Gateway and Thorchain, building separate blockchains for cross-chain lending and exchange.
Generalized: Protocols that are designed to transfer information across multiple blockchains. Allbridge is a generalized bridge for asset transfers. Another example is Chainlink, which bridges off-chain information across multiple networks.

Throw together 100+ networks and 40+ projects across four categories, and you end up with a market that is inherently fragmented. In essence, Allbridge competes with any project that facilitates asset transfers across networks. Projects like Compound Gateway and Chainlink are therefore not considered as competitors. Note that the competitive landscape illustrated below is not fully comprehensive for the sake of simplicity.

With the rise of alternative smart contract platforms, bridges to Ethereum are imperative to increase adoption. Ethereum bridges have therefore completely exploded this year. With barely $0.7 billion TVL in April, more than $22 billion worth of assets) are now locked in the market. That’s roughly 9% of TVL in smart contract platforms. At the time of writing, there have been 83,000 unique depositors over the past 30 days, and Polygon bridges hold the largest TVL at $6.0 billion. Avalanche bridges and Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge come in second and third at $5.4 and $4.8 billion, respectively. As alternative blockchains become more and more popular, these numbers will only multiply in the future.

Closing Summary

By now, it is clear that we are moving towards a multi-chain world. So instead of burning bridges, there is a growing need for cross-chain connectors. These bridge projects must support as many assets and networks as possible at the fastest speed and lowest cost possible. And while there is fierce competition in the market, builders must remain disciplined and implement the highest security standards to prevent malicious activity.

Allbridge is working towards a single-window system. It wants to offer a universal bridge where all assets can be accessed regardless of the blockchain. This is reflected in its roadmap. Broadly, the team is focusing on four main topics:

Blockchains: New networks are continuously integrated to strengthen its position as a generalized bridge. With 12 of the largest networks already supported on the platform, Allbridge aims to integrate Tezos, NEAR, Arbitrum, Optimism, and other networks next.
Decentralization: More validators will be added at the beginning of 2022, and a DAO interface will be launched to become a truly decentralized bridge. There is no planned date for the interface yet.
Marketing: Following its recent rebranding and UX improvements, Allbridge will launch a series of marketing campaigns and incentivization programs to attract users. The team will also establish DEX partnerships to build out its ecosystem.
B2B products: As the user-facing bridge becomes more established, Allbridge also wants to build its B2B offering. The team plans to launch an open API in Q1 2022 and implement an interface for project subscriptions. In the future, Allbridge seeks to offer a bridge-as-a-service API solution to AMMs and other projects.

Thus far, Allbridge has been able to deliver on its promises. Its modular architecture has proven itself an effective way to bridge new networks. Over the last several months, the platform has offered over 132 bridge directions across 12 networks. The project is also gaining traction, with over $5 billion bridged in total. It remains to be seen whether the team can guarantee security for the protocol and head up against more established players like Multichain. If Allbridge can continue this trajectory, there appears to be an exciting road ahead for the project.

Sector Returns

This is the first time in four weeks that not all sectors finish with negative returns. Four of the six sectors covered ended the week with positive returns. Impressively, Smart Contract Platforms, which had the largest decline last week, has seen the highest sector return this week. It took the first place returning 7.67%, followed by the DeFi sector bringing in 4.53%. Top Assets took the last spot as it brought a return of -1.17% for the week.

Top Assets

Top Assets brought a diverse set of returns as the sector had four assets end the week on the green while six were in the red. Solana(SOL) was the best performer of the sector as the alternate Layer 1 broke off from the pack during the second part of the week only to give back the gains and barely end the week on the lead, returning 8.9%. Following closely was Ethereum (ETH) as it ended the week with an 8.5% return. Terra (LUNA) was the clear laggard of the group, trading far below the rest and ultimately finishing the week with a 19.1% decline.

DeFi Assets

After three weeks of precipitous decline and $20 billion in total TVL wiped out, the DeFi sector has seen some signs of stability. As hinted on the <a href=""https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-january-20?referrer=author:guillermo-avil-s"">January 20 recap</a>, TVL broke the $220 billion critical support line and has settled on the September 2021 top of $200 billion as support. Maker (MKR) was the clear outperformer of the group ending the week with an impressive 26% return while the next best performer, Curve (CRV), was 18.3% away returning 7.7% on the week. Loopring (LRC) ended the week far below the rest of the group, returning a 19.3% loss.

Smart Contract Platforms

The Smart Contract Platform sector saw the most evenly distributed range of returns as half of the assets ended the week with positive returns while the other half recorded losses. Solana (SOL) was the best performer of the week returning 8.9% closely followed by Ethereum (ETH) with 8.5%. Cosmos (ATOM) and Terra (LUNA) broke downwards from the group early on and traded closely for the rest of the week. ATOM ultimately took the last spot returning -20.5% and LUNA -19.1%.

Currencies

For most of the week it seemed as if the majority of the assets in the Currencies sector would end the week with positive returns. Only three of the ten assets ended the week with a positive performance. Zcash (ZEC) was the best performer of the group by an 11.7% margin, returning a 13.3% gain while the next best performer was DASH (DASH) at 1.6%. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) took the last spot for the week ending with a 4.5% decline.

Web3

Render (RNDR) has not just been one of the best performers of the Web3 sector, but also the market. RNDR finds itself on a 34.8% gain while the rest of the market has been on a decline. RNDR is just one of the seven assets within the Web 3 sector that finished the week with positive returns while Helium (HNT), the best performer of last week, took the last spot with a 12.4% loss.

Gaming

Eight of the top ten assets by market capitalization within the Gaming sector brought positive returns for the week. The top performer was Yield Guild Games, bringing in a 15.1% return followed closely by Sandbox (SAND) with 14.1%. The rest of the group had returns ranging from 9.8% down to -2.7% with Axie Infinity (AXS) taking the last spot.

Messari’s mission is to organize and curate critical information for crypto professionals. Since day one, we have realized that this means bringing transparency to the space so that information can be trusted. Our internal policies have reflected this in how we source, analyze, and present information. As the business has grown, we have expanded the “people” side, which means that more individuals are focused on three of our core product lines: Pro Research, Registry, and Intel.

It is essential for individuals in the crypto space to participate in networks so they can objectively evaluate them. Given that these networks are decentralized, our employees are often required to obtain tokens (assets) in order to participate in or transact on them. These assets have value. Assets with value can become investments. There is never a bright line, but we find it important to hold our team to the highest standards of transparency so as to best serve the crypto community.

Messari Lists

Messari Lists features watchlists created by our employees. These lists are created to highlight interesting projects that the team is watching and in no way a recommendation to buy a specific token. Employees may, or may not, personally own tokens on these lists. Please see the below Employee Holdings for a list of what each employee owns.

da29ae64-f6bf-46b9-994b-58c2e68ff5e9,UXD - Tackling the Stablecoin Trilemma,"The following report was commissioned by UXD, a member of <a href=""https://messari.io/hub"">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.

Stablecoins are one of the most important aspects in all of crypto. All major trading pairs on CEXs and DEXs alike are denominated in stablecoins. Volumes of stablecoins often exceed BTC volumes and ETH volumes. Stables are by far the most borrowed assets on decentralized money markets (27x more USDC is borrowed on Aave than ETH). Yearn’s most popular yield vaults are stablecoin vaults. Perpetual exchange protocols, which offer the most popular derivatives, are almost always collateralized against stablecoins.

Stablecoins are the foundation of nearly all that is DeFi.

However, not all stablecoins are alike. Tradeoffs exist for all stablecoin implementations. Each stablecoin exists along a spectrum of decentralization, stability, and efficiency. Together, these aspects formulate the stablecoin trilemma which plagues stablecoin designs as optimization along one aspect usually leads to degradation in another. The stablecoin trilemma can be defined as:

Decentralization: How dependent is the stablecoin on centralized systems?
Stability: Does the stablecoin remain at its peg without large variances, especially during times of market volatility when stable assets become high in demand?
Efficiency: How much capital is required to secure the stablecoin? More capital required, the less efficient and vice versa.

Stablecoin implementations largely fall into three categories: Fiat, Collateral Debt Position (CDP), or Algorithmic (algo). Fiat stablecoins are backed by corresponding fiat dollars (or other currency) in a traditional, centralized entity. For example, USDC is issued/burned by corresponding TradFi banks who are responsible for maintaining cash and cash equivalents in custody to back issued stablecoins. Collateral Debt Position stables are issued by decentralized protocols that accept collateral and issue debt in the form of a stablecoin. Collateral backing CDP is often greater than the amount of stablecoin debt issued in order to protect the protocol from fluctuations in the collateral token price. All in all, CDP stablecoins are backed by individual user deposited collateral. Algorithmic stablecoins have the widest spectrum of implementations with various algo stablecoins having noticeably different properties. However, each algorithmic stablecoin leans on a combination of game theoretic and mechanistic systems to ensure stability of the token.

Since fiat-backed stablecoins require a trusted centralized partner and collateral debt position tokens require overcollateralization due to the volatile assets accepted as collateral, algo stablecoins present the best opportunity for DeFi to solve the stablecoin trilemma with a scalable, decentralized, and efficiently scalable stablecoin. And decentralized markets are echoing this sentiment. Demand for stablecoins which can solve the trilemma and ensure long-term viability have skyrocketed over the previous year.

In Q4, the Algo stablecoin market cap grew 260%, significantly outpacing fiat and CDP-based stablecoins which expanded market caps by 18% and 87% respectively. At this pace, algo stablecoins are set to pass collateralized debt stables as the second largest category of stablecoins in Q1 2022. However, there is a significant differential between the supply of fiat stablecoins and algo stablecoins. Fiat stablecoin market capitalization is roughly 10x more than both collateral debt and algo stablecoins. This value gap is the market opportunity for algo stables as the more efficient scalability properties play out over the next year.

Current leading algo stablecoins include UST, FRAX, and FEI. Each employs a mechanism of redemptions which alongside supply and demand forces work to keep the stablecoin price pegged. UST, for example, works by minting/burning Luna in exchange for UST so that when the UST stablecoin begins to trade over the peg, Luna can be burned and exchanged for UST at a 1:1 dollar ratio (which is at the peg, but below the current price) to be sold into the market for a small profit. Creation of more UST in this scenario pushes the UST price closer to peg via supply and demand forces. This mechanism ensures that UST always has a market for $1. Luna in this scenario absorbs the supply and demand volatility that plagues stablecoins.

Frax works similarly with regards to the redemption mechanism of Luna, except FRAX is algorithmically collateralized by a floating collateral factor. Collateral factor simply defines how much USD value of collateral backs the stablecoin FRAX. At a collateral factor of 1, there is one dollar for every FRAX in reserves. As the collateral factor drops (by design in order to scale efficiently), less collateral is required per FRAX. Redemptions change by issuing FXS, the protocol’s governance token, alongside collateral (USDC) in line with the current collateral ratio. For example, with a collateral ratio of 0.75, redemptions would net $0.75 sourced from the collateral pools of the protocol and $0.25 worth of minted FXS which in total is $1 for every redeemed FRAX. Frax as a protocol also employs other mechanisms contributing to the stability of the protocol which by and large utilize collateral in market operations such as liquidity provisions, investments, or lending (these modules are referred as AMOs by Frax).

With the release of V2, FEI too deploys a redemption mechanism as the primary stability force for its algo stablecoin. Unlike FRAX, FEI is overcollateralized by its Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) reserves which consist of a variety of assets ranging from stables like DAI to volatile assets like ETH and Ethereum DeFi tokens. PCV serves both to fund 1:1 redemptions of FEI as well as to seed liquidity in trading pools guaranteeing FEI can trade at high volumes. Due to the volatile nature of the PCV collateral, FEI can shift from being overcollateralized to undercollateralized at which point redemptions would be funded with newly minted Tribe. Redemptions enable the supply of FEI to scale at a minimum 1:1 ratio relative to collateral while also enabling a stability mechanism for FEI as market volatility changes supply and demand ratios of collateral and FEI.

Redemptions are the key stability mechanism utilized by current algo stables because each either has a one of or a combination of the following; volatile collateral (FEI), undercollateralized (FRAX), or requires volatility absorption mechanisms via a complementary token (UST). All because of one simple fact, none of these protocols have consistent, guaranteed backing 1:1 of collateral to stablecoins. Why don’t fiat backed stablecoins require sophisticated mechanisms of stability? Because there is faith in 1:1 backing of cash assets to each stablecoin irrespective of market volatility.

So why can’t an algorithmic stablecoin create the same guaranteed backing but without centralized cash backing?

UXD Stablecoin

UXD is a recently launched stablecoin protocol native to Solana. UXD aims to solve the stablecoin trilemma with a unique algorithmic design that is backed 1:1 for stable-like assets instead of relying on redemption methods to absorb volatility.

Each UXD token is backed by a delta-neutral position on a perpetual derivatives exchange.

While sounding complicated, the design is actually rather simple. Users deposit collateral such as SOL to the protocol and receive $1 of UXD in return for every $1 of SOL deposited. The SOL is then deposited to a perpetual exchange protocol (Mango Markets) as collateral and then an opposite short position is taken at the same value of the deposited SOL. So if the price of SOL falls -10%, the deposited SOL collateral would lose -10% of USD value, however, at the same time, the short position would gain +10% of USD value resulting in a net 0% move of UXD’s collateral in USD terms.

Having a net 0% move relative to the underlying asset is the definition of delta-neutral. Effectively, the UXD protocol simulates having stable assets as collateral but with volatile assets enabling it to back each UXD token 1:1 with decentralized assets.

When a user wishes to redeem UXD for collateral, the process flows in reverse. Users burn UXD with the protocol and in return receive the exact USD amount in SOL or the collateral token of their choice. To return the user’s SOL, the protocol closes the SOL short position on the perpetual exchange for the exact dollar amount of UXD burned and the freed up SOL collateral is withdrawn to the UXD protocol at which point it is returned to the user.

As a result, the supply of UXD can scale much faster and much more efficiently than CDP stablecoins since these require more USD value of collateral than stables issued. UXD with its 1:1 stable asset backed position should more closely resemble the stability of fiat-backed stablecoins, but with the added benefit of being decentralized and censorship resistant. This same stability property is an added advantage compared to other algorithmic stables which rely on redemptions and secondary tokens to absorb volatility. Mechanisms like such are highly complex and have in the past broken peg in times of high volatility.

Framing the UXD token against the stablecoin trilemma:

Decentralization: UXD utilizes decentralized assets to form stable USD positions (delta-neutral) and the UXD protocol is itself designed as decentralized and its overall decentralization is dependent on the perpetual protocols it leverages.
Stability: Collateral in UXD is traditionally volatile but synthetically stabilized via derivatives, recreating the dependability of fiat backed stablecoins without reliance on centralized providers. Also, the protocol design relies on 1:1 backing guarantee with collateral assets rather than complex redemption mechanisms involving non-collateral assets (FXS and LUNA) which have only had a short history combating volatility.
Efficiency: UXD scales at a rate of $1 UXD for every $1 deposited in collateral which is far more efficient than collateral debt position stables which require more than $1 to mint $1 in stables. While the 1:1 mechanism favors stability, it is less efficient than floating collateral factor stablecoins like FRAX which can have less than $1 in collateral for every $1 in stables. Large enough perpetual markets is the chief constraint on UXD scalability, not collateral.

For the protocol to have long term viability, a revenue source is required to align incentives and fund growth. UXD Protocol doesn’t plan to collect fees from users but rather to absorb cash flows from an integral part of perpetual exchanges - the funding rate. Funding payments on perpetual exchanges arise due to the fact traders on the exchange are trading representations of tokens, not actual tokens. Since there are no actual tokens involved, the market price on the perpetual exchange can deviate from the true market price of the underlying token being traded. To keep prices aligned, a funding payment is introduced which scales relative to the trade imbalance. If the traders on the perp exchange are overweight on the long side (which is often the case in crypto), then the funding payment would be positive where the long traders pay a percentage fee to traders holding short positions. This mechanism incentivizes traders to take the unpopular side of the trade which has the effect of pushing the perpetual exchange price back towards the true market price.

Since funding historically has been positive in crypto markets, that means traders with short positions like UXD Protocol will receive funding payments from traders with long positions. However, this is not always the case and when funding turns negative, UXD Protocol requires a mechanism to pay funding payments without impacting UXD holders. To do so, an insurance fund is employed which was adequately funded ($57M) in the IDO sale of the UXP token.

Overall, like many stablecoin projects, UXD aims to drive real productive use cases for the stablecoin. Productive use cases are largely centered around financial usage as opposed to speculation or a rewards vehicle. For example, debts denominated in a stablecoin drive real usage as borrowers subsequently use the stable in swaps and continue to hold the stable in regard as their debts are denominated in the token. This drives the need for deep money market pools (borrowing) and for liquid AMM pools (swaps). Less productive uses involve staking and farming which drive liquidity but ultimately are unstable, short-term masquerades of adoption. UXD’s stated roadmap is focused on driving long-term health through more productive uses of the stablecoin.

UXD Tokenomics

UXD protocol is governed by the UXP token. UXP was offered in a public IDO ending November 14th that raised over $57M from 3,676 investors. Funds raised in the IDO are directed towards the insurance fund which is responsible for backstopping any negative funding payments incurred on the perpetual exchanges and any protocol exploit. According to the UXD documentation, the insurance fund at its current size would be able to sustain a year’s worth of -11.4% interest on $500M of UXD. Governing the insurance fund is the responsibility of the forthcoming UXP DAO.

In addition to IDO funds, UXD raised a $3M seed round from prominent solana ecosystem investors Multicoin, Alameda Research, Defiance Capital, CMS Holdings, Solana Foundation, Mercurial Finance, Solana Founders Anatoly Yakavenko and Raj Gokal, and Saber DEX founder Dylan Macalinao.

UXP holders will be the sole governing body of the UXD DAO. As such, holders are responsible for stewardship of the insurance fund and participating in governing actions. Potential governing actions could include adding new exchange integrations, adding new collateral types, protocol income management, and general improvements to the protocol.

Revenue for the UXD protocol is derived from two main sources. First and foremost is the positive funding payments as a result of the short position on the perpetual exchange. Funding in crypto has historically been positive meaning UXD, over the long term, can be expected to rely on this revenue stream as the primary source of cash inflows.

UXD Protocol’s second form of income is from active management of the insurance fund. Non-essential to business operations, the insurance fund is usually kept idle, only to be used during times of negative funding (shorts traders overweight longs on the perp exchange). For capital efficiency, UXD will explore asset management strategies for the insurance fund. Ultimately though it will be up to the UXP holders to dictate the management of the insurance fund.

Protocol Challenges

Outside of general smart contract risk, there exist a few key challenge areas for a protocol like UXD to not just work, but to scale efficiently to the size a stablecoin protocol needs.

Perpetual Market Size - Currently there is roughly $30M in open interest on Solana Perpetual Exchanges ($17M on Mango across all their L1 token markets and $11M on Drift Protocol). Stablecoin marketcaps require nearly $1B in market cap to be considered successful and to be considered sufficiently liquid for widespread use. In order for UXD to reach significant levels of adoption, the amount of market activity on Solana Perpetual exchanges would need to scale significantly. At the current size of the perp markets, UXD would almost assuredly drive the funding rates negative on the exchanges since it would create an imbalance of positions to the short side. However, this would attract more traders to trade against cheaper fund borrowing rates so there is a self-referential playbook here that can scale both UXD and the perpetual markets on Solana.

Negative Funding Rates - Along the same vein, when funding rates on the perpetual exchange turn negative, it’s on the UXD protocol itself to pay out. Usually, funding rates are positive in crypto due to the much larger demand to be on the long side of assets and in this case UXD protocol would be making additional money via traders paying it funding. However, if UXD scales faster than OI on the exchanges, there exists a real possibility funding could get driven negative and the protocol would be paying. To counteract this probability, sufficient funds are stored in the insurance fund to cover negative funding periods (which have historically not been long in duration). In the unlikely event that the insurance fund is depleted paying funding payments, additional UXP would be auctioned off to replenish the insurance fund. Even in this unlikely event, the insurance fund would not rapidly be depleted via funding payments (no flash crashes, just fairly predictable payments over known periods of time) so UXD holders would nearly always be able to redeem for collateral.

Exchange Exit Liquidity - Related to exchange sizes, there needs to exist enough counterside liquidity for UXD to unwind its short positions. UXD by design puts on short positions every time a user deposits collateral into the protocol, but when the UXD holder wishes to exchange the stablecoin for their collateral, the short position needs to be unwound and the collateral returned. For this to happen, there needs to be liquidity (users or market makers) on the exchange willing to sell tokens to UXD protocol in the size required. This risk is more prevalent in times of market volatility.

Treasury Management - UXD as a protocol is designed not to make money from UXD users but in the way it manages its collateral (positive funding rates) and its insurance fund. As the insurance fund is deployed in asset management strategies, the benefit is clearly the capital appreciation of the fund size. However, on the flip side there is introduced risk that funds are subjected to which needs to be taken into account. Not a great concern as presumably the fund will be deployed in low-risk strategies with the only notable risk being smart contract risk.

UXD Supply and Demand - Every stablecoin is subject to fluctuations in demand which can drive prices off peg. What matters is the ability of the protocol to absorb price volatility via redemption mechanisms to remain at peg or user confidence in the future redemption abilities (fiat stablecoins). UXD offers both avenues but as a growing stablecoin, it’s still subjected to the risk - especially in its early stages when concentrated amounts of UXD can experience more volatility pressure than if the supply of UXD was vast.

Looking Ahead

UXD offers a unique solution to the stablecoin landscape. As Solana continues to build out its DeFi ecosystem, having truly decentralized, native stablecoins will greatly benefit the ecosystem as a whole. Market demand for this type of solution is rapidly increasing, not just on Solana, but across DeFi as projects and users alike look for stable assets without centralization risk and that synergistically benefit the ecosystem. UXD has the potential to propel Solana’s already thriving derivatives market into new territory by catalyzing the cost of trading down and providing sufficient stable liquidity.

Introduction to Compound

Launched in September 2018, Compound is a leading interest rate protocol built on Ethereum that enables users to permissionlessly borrow and lend assets from a pool of collateral. It sets interest rates for those assets algorithmically using an interest rate model based on the proportion of assets lent out, which it calls the utilization ratio. Compound launched its V2 protocol in May 2019, which introduced additional assets, individual risk models, and smart contract gateways for each asset, among other features. In April 2020, Compound replaced the administrator of the protocol with community governance, empowering COMP token holders to take control of the protocol. In June 2020, Compound <a href=""https://messari.io/article/the-agricultural-revolution-of-defi-is-underway?referrer=grid-view"">began distributing</a> COMP to users via a pioneering liquidity mining program reserving 42% of the total COMP supply to be distributed to users over the next four years.

Compound Markets - Macro Overview

Fueled by strong overall market conditions that saw two all-time high breakouts from Bitcoin in Q4, Compound closed the quarter with quarter-ending highs in several key categories - namely outstanding loans and outstanding deposits.

Strictly looking at quarter-ending figures, outstanding loans and outstanding deposits saw modest growth at 7.5% and 1.0%, respectively. Net income grew over 19% as market conditions dramatically improved from Q3, which attracted new borrowing demand, driving increases in interest income (+11%) and liquidation income (+27%).

Plaguing the quarter-ending figures, however, are two key periods worth noting. On the quarterly close date of Q3, the COMP distribution bug caused roughly $3B worth of closed loans and withdrawn deposits. As a result, Q3 quarter-ending figures drastically underrepresent the state of usage of Compound at the time. Comparison of the underrepresented Q3 figures to quarter-ending Q4 figures masquerades modest declines in usage as modest growth.

Upon resolution of the COMP distribution bug in mid-October, capital quickly reestablished prior levels of usage at approximately $18B of deposits and over $7B of outstanding loans. Capital levels remained at these levels until late November when broader crypto markets began to sell off causing leverage demand and collateral deposits to wane going into the last month of the quarter. As such, Q4 quarter-ending figures represent a state of a slow decline of usage as opposed to the modest growth reflected in the quarter-to-quarter figures.

Outstanding Loans, while up 7.5% on the quarter, are down 23% from the highs established in early December. Loans remain predominantly in stables (USDC and DAI) as borrowers overwhelmingly favor stable forms of debt over volatile debts. During the contraction in borrow demand across December, DAI exhibited less overall loan contraction (-23%) than the more favorable borrowed USDC (-30%). As a result, DAI surpassed USDC as the most heavily borrowed asset on Compound to end the quarter.

Borrower interest rates saw upwards volatility in October, with interest rates normalizing shortly afterward through the end of the quarter at slightly higher levels than otherwise seen in Q3. The average annualized borrowing rate for the quarter saw a moderate increase from 4.1% in Q3 to 5.0% in Q4. October’s borrowing rate volatility was due to two primary factors acting in tandem. First was the relatively slow redeposits of stables following the rapid withdrawals during the COMP distribution bug leading to a low supply of the most borrowed assets. The second was the general market conditions reaching all-time highs driving significant demand for leverage. Both forces working together - one causing low supply and the other demand spikes - resulted in borrowing rate volatility.

Similar to outstanding loans, by the end of the quarter, outstanding deposits had fallen 26% from the quarterly highs established, resulting in a relatively flat quarterly growth rate of 0.2%. With rising asset prices factored out, growth rates would have turned negative for Q4. WETH remained the largest deposited asset on Compound while DAI contributed the most to outstanding deposit growth as Coinbase’s new ‘DeFi Yield’ product opened a new influx of DAI through December to counteract the general withdraws occurring across Compound markets during the month. DAI is now the second most deposited asset in Compound and the most borrowed asset.

Outside of rate fluctuations during the COMP Distribution withdrawal period, depositor interest rates during the quarter stayed relatively in line with Q3’s all-time-low interest rates. Rates slightly increased over the quarter with the average annualized depositor rate increasing from 1.8% to 2.0%. Rate stabilization at these levels is indicative of product maturity as Compound liquidity consistently matched borrowing demand.

Compound’s aggregate utilization ratio continued to trend downwards, starting at the beginning of 2021, which best highlights the trend of depositor growth continuing to outpace loan growth. Additional sources of on-chain leverage coming online mid-2021 and rapidly maturing stablecoin liquidity continue to ease down Compound utilization rates as supply meets demand.

Quarterly interest income rebounded in Q4, increasing 16% from $78 million to $90 million, as the combination of interest rate spikes and sustained periods of high deposits and borrowing drove additional income compared to Q3’s largely risk-off environment. DAI and USDC accounted for the greatest drivers of interest income due to their borrowing popularity, representing nearly 75% of all interest income generated in Compound markets for the quarter.

Compound generates protocol income by implementing a “reserve factor,” which is a percentage taken out of the interest paid by borrowers that can be used by governance for a variety of use-case or act as an insurance against borrower default. Reserve factors vary by asset, with DAI having the highest reserve factor of all stablecoins (the most borrowed asset on Compound) on the platform at 15%. For this reason, DAI has consistently been the most significant contributor to protocol income over the past five quarters, generating over 50% of protocol income in Q4. Protocol income increased 11% in Q4 rising from $9 million to $10 million, primarily attributed to DAI representing a larger share of the outstanding loans.

New loans (originations) continued to trend downwards significantly (-31% on the quarter) while overall outstanding loans remained relatively flat. Nearly 65% of the Q4 originations occurred in October when liquidity reestablished levels prior to the COMP distribution bug. Following this period, new loan demand dampened across the quarter ultimately leading towards regression in overall loan volumes in December.

Deposit volume increased significantly in the quarter which can be attributed to both deposits flowing back into Compound markets after the COMP distribution bug resolution and the new Coinbase ‘DeFi Yield’ product. DAI made up 70% of the deposit volume in Q4 with 75% of the new DAI deposits occurring after the launch of the Coinbase integration in early December.

Liquidations increased 28% in Q4 from $27 million to $34 million, which is relatively low compared to previous quarters. Liquidations remain near the lowest levels seen in the past year due to relatively muted volatility and maturing markets.

Lastly, one of the key drivers of all the activity in the Compound markets is the COMP token incentives for depositors and borrowers. Token incentives on a USD basis declined in Q4 by -35%, driven by COMP prices continuing to decline to a new low not seen in nearly a year. However, on a token basis, COMP rewards were only down -4.6%, primarily due to the COMP distribution bug remediations and pausing of COMP rewards for borrowing COMP.

Compound Markets - Micro Overview

Compound’s markets saw quite a few changes in Q4, including modifications to risk parameters across various assets, the addition of a Pax Dollar (USDP) market, and a flippening in the largest borrowing market compared to Q3. Stablecoins continue to be the most popular borrowing asset over more volatile assets, following the trend from previous quarters of stablecoins maintaining high utilization rates while the volatile assets remain in the single digits for utilization. The five largest Compound markets are further analyzed below.

DAI

In Q4, DAI became Compound’s largest market by loans outstanding and was the single greatest driver to outstanding loan growth in the quarter, increasing 35% from $2 billion to $2.8 billion. DAI was also the most significant driver of outstanding deposit growth this quarter, increasing 37% from $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion, with deposit volume increasing 587% from $6.5 billion to $44 billion. This large increase in demand and outperformance compared to other markets can be attributed to Coinbase’s integration with the Compound protocol within their new DeFi Yield product, which allows users to earn a variable interest rate on DAI. The utilization rate decreased 1.2% by the end of the quarter, causing borrower interest rates to stay relatively flat, decreasing from 4.7% at the beginning of the quarter to 4.5% by the end of the quarter.

With the large inflow of DAI entering Compound’s markets, DAI ended the quarter replacing USDC as the most popular borrowing asset, representing 46% of all the outstanding loans.

USDC

USDC saw a decrease of 7% in outstanding loans this quarter after being the largest driver to loan growth in Q3. Utilization rates decreased roughly 5% due to subsiding borrowing activity, which resulted in interest rates decreasing from 7.6% to 4.4% by the end of the quarter.

USDT

USDT was largely a similar story to USDC in Q4. Low growth of around 1% in outstanding loans coupled with a nearly 6% increase in overall deposits resulted in a 4% decline in utilization. USDT interest rates fell slightly from 5.6% to 4.8% at the end of the quarter as a result.

WBTC

Outstanding loans for WBTC increased 13%, ringing in an all-time quarterly high of $135 billion. Outstanding deposits slightly decreased 2% in the quarter despite BTC’s price rising from $43,825 to $47,121. This increase in price artificially supported the outstanding deposit metric, which would’ve decreased 12% from Q3 to Q4 if BTC’s price would have stayed constant. After the BTC price peaked in late October, WBTC deposits remained relatively flat throughout the end of the year.

WETH

WETH is Compound’s largest market by deposits outstanding but had a slightly negative quarter decreasing 3% from $5.5 billion to $5.4 billion. ETH’s price increased from $2,938 in Q3 to $3,739 in Q4, a 27% increase. Without ETH’s price appreciation, deposits outstanding in Q4 would have been down 28%.

WETH represents 38% of Compound’s deposits outstanding, with DAI now being the second largest at 24%, surpassing USDC.

Governance & Key Events:

Key Events

Coinbase Integration

In early December, Coinbase announced its users in 70+ countries (excluding the US) would have access to Coinbase’s first DeFi protocol integration product, ‘DeFi Yield’. With ‘DeFi Yield’ users are able to earn a variable yield on DAI through the Compound Protocol. Coinbase offers the product without gas cost, fees, or lockups. As a result, the average daily DAI deposits tripled following the announcement. Average daily DAI deposits in the quarter prior to the announcement were $0.16B while after the product release on December 9th, $1.4B DAI on average was deposited into Compound.

Executed just prior to Q3 close,<a href=""https://messari.io/governor/proposal/d0c0861c-96a2-49df-b483-439d6d6f7d8f"">Proposal 062</a> implemented a bifurcation of COMP rewards between deposits and borrows while also unintentionally introducing a bug that exposed certain markets to excess COMP rewards should users choose to claim the erroneously accrued COMP. As a result, ~200k COMP ($68M) was sent to the Compound Controller and misallocated.

Shortly after the bug’s discovery,<a href=""https://messari.io/governor/proposal/8176960c-8d68-4390-9ee3-3a3db52142ec"">Proposal 064</a> was passed and executed to patch the bug.<a href=""https://messari.io/governor/proposal/29a8ee16-0e17-48d7-9fdf-95cefd629fef"">Proposal 065</a> quickly followed in mid-October, which implemented a mechanism to recover over-accrued COMP and reestablished COMP rewards across the protocol.

To safeguard against future security concerns like the accrual bug, the Compound community invited proposals from a variety of firms to perform ongoing security reviews. In mid-December,<a href=""https://messari.io/governor/proposal/f264556c-82d8-496e-9492-4aa8a925ef43"">Proposal 076</a> approved engagement with OpenZeppelin for continuous audit and security solutions.

MakerDAO Deposit Module

In early December, GFX Labs and the Compound community proposed to MakerDAO to prioritize a Compound DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M). D3M is a Maker Protocol implementation that enables Maker to directly inject DAI into the Compound DAI borrowing market. Currently, Aave is the only protocol to which D3M has been implemented. Voting passed on the MakerDAO poll in January 2022.

Governance Decisions

Proposal 076 - OpenZeppelin Continuous Protocol Audit - December 21st, 2021

OpenZeppelin would provide a dedicated continuous audit services for all Compound governance proposals and will work with the Compound community to develop security requirements and to implement best practice security monitoring.

OpenZeppelin has revised its original proposal to exclude performance fees. OpenZeppelin’s fee will be the equivalent of $1 million USD in COMP every quarter for one year, to provide these services. This fee covers all services defined in the proposal.

OpenZeppelin’s proposal was considered by the community alongside Trails of Bits and ChainSecurity proposals. OpenZeppelin ended up winning the bid to provide continuous audit and security services to Compound.

Proposal 074 - Risk Parameter Updates for WBTC, BAT, and LINK - December 20th, 2021

Proposal 074 aimed to adjust three total parameters across three Compound assets. It changed the WBTC, BAT, and LINK markets as follows: cBAT Collateral Factor from 60% to 65%, cLINK Collateral Factor from 65% to 70%, cWBTC2 Collateral Factor from 65% to 70%.

Proposal 073 - Add PAX Dollar (USDP) - December 20th, 2021

Paxos Standard was added as a stablecoin on Compound with the proposed risk parameters: collateral factor 0-25%, reserve factor 20-30%, no COMP speed, borrow cap 80%.

Proposal 072 - Risk Parameter Updates for WBTC, UNI, and COMP - December 8th, 2021

Proposal 072 adjusted three total parameters across three Compound assets. It changed the WBTC, UNI, and COMP markets as follows: WBTC Collateral Factor from 65% to 70%, UNI Collateral Factor from 60% to 70%, COMP Collateral Factor from 60% to 65%.

Proposal 071 - Risk Parameter Updates for DAI, BAT, ZRX, and ETH - November 27th, 2021

Proposal 071 adjusted four total parameters across four Compound assets to align with the moderate risk level chosen by the Compound community. It would: Set cZRX collateral factor to 60.0%, set cBAT collateral factor to 60.0%, set cDAI collateral factor to 80.0%, set cETH collateral factor to 80.0%.

Proposal 069 - Risk Parameter Updates for LINK, MKR, SUSHI, and YFI - November 17th, 2021

Proposal 069 adjusted 4 total parameters across 4 Compound assets. This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the Moderate risk level chosen by the Compound community. These parameter updates are the second of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of Dynamic Risk Parameters: set cLINK collateral factor to 65.0%, set cMKR collateral factor to 55.0%, set cSUSHI collateral factor to 55.0%, set cYFI collateral factor to 60.0%.

Proposal 068 - End cCOMP Borrow Rewards - November 12th, 2021

Proposal 068 stopped COMP rewards for cCOMP borrowing using the new Comptroller function allowing for splitting COMP speeds. COMP rewards will remain the same for cCOMP suppliers.

Proposal 066 - Risk Parameter Updates for AAVE, LINK, MKR, SUSHI, USDC, and YFI - November 9th, 2021

Proposal 066 adjusted 6 total parameters across 6 Compound assets. The adjustments were as follows: set cAAVE collateral factor to 60.0%, set cLINK collateral factor to 60.0%, set cMKR collateral factor to 45.0%, set cSUSHI collateral factor to 45.0%, set cUSDC collateral factor to 80.0%, set cYFI collateral factor to 55.0%.

Proposal 065 - Correct Over-Accrued COMP - October 19th, 2021

This proposal corrects the amounts of over-accrued COMP due to the bug in Proposal 62 (September 29th) and fully restores the functionality of COMP rewards. It contains an exact list of users who have over-accrued COMP along with the exact amounts they over-accrued and calls a newly introduced one-off function, fixBadAccruals, to correct the over-accrued COMP.

Proposal 064 - Fix COMP Accrual Bug - October 9th, 2021

Proposal 064 patched the bug introduced in Proposal 62 and pessimistically allow COMP reward withdrawals until the bad COMP accruals can be fixed.

This new proposal also corrected proposal 63 which prevents further COMP from being distributed until the correct logic is restored but causes issues for protocols that integrated with Compound and required the claim functionality.

Governance Discussions

COMP Distribution Speeds

After analyzing Compound and its markets’ compSpeed, GFX Labs proposed reducing compSpeed across markets. CompSpeed is essentially the amount of COMP distributed to suppliers and borrowers and acts as a liquidity incentive. GFX Lab’s core premise is that the roughly $160M spent annually in compSpeeds is overpaying for liquidity when sufficient liquidity already exists (new markets added being the exception).

Discussion centers around either reducing compSpeed to zero, gradually reducing the compSpeed, or doing nothing at all.

Grant Program Overview:

The Compound Grants Program (CGP) 1.0 was an enormously successful experiment that ran from March 2021 to September 2021 with the simple idea of funding contributors to improve Compound. The program funded over 30 grantees with over $1 million in funding which went towards open-source dashboards, analytics, hackathons and much more.

With the conclusion of the first iteration of the grants program, a pause has been put on all new grants leading to zero grants being distributed in Q4. With the success of the initial grant pilot program, the grant committee members are preparing to double-down and create a grant program that is superior to GCP 1.0 in grant size, speed, and structure. GCP 2.0 is currently being built with no launch date announced yet.

Roadmap

Near-term objectives for Compound are to continue to add new markets and refine risk parameters, especially with the newly added OpenZeppelin continuous audit, which removes the burden of security from the community.

Further out objectives are largely centered around two main efforts from Compound Labs: Treasury and Gateway. Treasury is Compound’s B2B offering which aims to offer Compound yields to traditional firms. Gateway is the larger undertaking that is poised to holistically re-architect Compound to efficiently meet global scale demands.

Gateway

In March of 2021, Compound Labs announced a prototype based on a whitepaper for Compound Chain, an independent blockchain that would serve as infrastructure for cross-chain interest rate markets, known as Gateway. Gateway intended to be a Substrate-based blockchain that would facilitate borrowing and lending of native assets across various external blockchains. The goal was to introduce a new stablecoin, CASH, to be Gateway’s native unit created through borrowing, much like MakerDAO’s DAI, where all interest would be earned and paid in CASH.

This cross-chain interoperability was an ambitious and challenging undertaking with the potential to revolutionize the cross-chain lending and borrowing industry. Since the announcement of the Gateway project last year, the Compound Labs team had released multiple versions of a Gateway prototype, numerous other teams started experimenting with multi-chain approaches, and several cross-chain protocols lost assets to security incidents.

Due to those events in the past year and the incredible speed at which the crypto ecosystem has been developing, the Compound Labs team decided to adapt and proposed an alternate approach to what they believe is the correct multi-chain strategy. The team decided that it was prudent to initially focus on launching Compound on EVM-compatible chains as fragmented markets rather than launch Gateway connected to starports on external chains. This alternate approach eliminates the risk and complexity involved with a shared liquidity pool, which the community can eventually decide to upgrade to in the future.

In Compound’s markets, stablecoins continue to be the most popular asset to borrow while more volatile assets are more popular as collateral. From this observation, one of the biggest design changes Compound Labs is proposing for their multi-chain approach is to only allow a single borrowable asset with an N number of collateral assets. This would create only one asset with an interest rate model, which would improve protocol risk and reduce the code base.

The next steps Compound Labs have outlined are to complete the initial code-base, begin security audits, deploy to test nets, and eventually launch the protocol on Ethereum when the community decides. From there, the community will have the ability to deploy the protocol on any external blockchain.

Closing Thoughts:

Being a financial services business, Compound will always be influenced to an extent by the broader market and macro environment. Q4 started with a strong recovery in outstanding loans and deposits as capital flowed back into Compound markets after the COMP distribution bug caused a liquidity contraction at the end of Q3. Capital remained at those elevated levels throughout the quarter until the broader market began selling off towards the end of the year, driving Compound’s metrics down with it. Overall, Compound’s quarter-ending figures sit at all-time highs in key metrics like outstanding loans and deposits, as well as strong growth in net protocol income.

With Compound being one of the first protocols that has moved towards distributed governance and distributed development, incidents such as Proposal 062’s COMP distribution bug are a reflection of the organization model’s experimental nature. The Compound community has used this incident as a catalyst for change, where more participants will be involved with the governance and development process, leading to more thorough analysis and reviews on proposals going forward. The community has come out of Q4 stronger and with more lessons and tools under its belt. With the community focused on new protocol updates, exchange and protocol integration, and institutional adoption of DeFi, the future of the Compound protocol continues to shine bright.

27fd8606-5cf7-49aa-adb2-93f22692dc23,Centrifugal Transparency for Tokenized Assets,"The following report was commissioned by Centrifuge, a member of <a href=""https://messari.io/hub"">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.

One reason for the financial crisis of 2008 was the lack of transparency into the quality of the loans packaged for resale. Mortgages were bundled off-chain, tranched off-chain, marketed off-chain, and painstakingly pieced back together off-chain when the financial system collapsed.

Founded in 2018, Centrifuge’s vision is to enable a DeFi structured money market where transparency exists right down to the individual asset (e.g., title to a piece of commercial real-estate) contained in a pool of collateral. Different participants will work together to bring the relevant data on-chain: asset originators, financial auditors, fraud scoring specialists, and valuation experts. When Centrifuge’s vision becomes a reality, financial services will be provided more transparently and efficiently by crypto native innovators. Similar to how Web2 brought massive efficiencies and economies of scale to commerce, Web3 bridged to real-world assets will eliminate rent-seeking behavior from intermediaries such as banks, lawyers, notaries, assessors, and underwriters.

Centrifuge wants to increase transparency, but not at the cost of revealing private data for everyone to see on the blockchain. The Centrifuge protocol has native support for managing these privacy requirements. For example, only parties with a need to know the borrower’s identity have access to it.

Centrifuge aims to prove that tokenizing and financing real-world assets on-chain is more efficient and more transparent than the existing solutions in traditional finance. The first dozen asset pools have been live since 2021, with more to come.

Real-World Assets

Real-world assets are different from other crypto assets. Crypto assets often derive their value from other crypto assets. Real-world assets (RWA) are very tangible (e.g., a title to a house), somewhat tangible (e.g., an invoice for 1,000 tires due in 60 days), or less tangible (e.g., future streaming royalties of a collection of songs by a particular artist).

To securely finance real-world assets on-chain, there needs to be a legal and commercial framework in place for ensuring that the process of providing the title to the asset as collateral is sound and that someone lending against the collateral can be assured legal recourse in the case of a non-performing loan. In mature markets, such as the US, well-established frameworks exist for repossessing an asset in such a case, and Centrifuge - at least initially - builds on these frameworks. Appropriately, it will take time before Centrifuge becomes available to borrowers in countries with less developed legal frameworks.

Centrifuge’s main achievement has been developing a technology and a framework for bridging RWAs and DeFi. Centrifuge is not a lender; it is a platform providing the right primitives for lending based on real-world collateral.

The Centrifuge Chain and the Centrifuge Token

Source: Centrifuge

The Centrifuge stack has a peer-to-peer messaging protocol to store and exchange business documents in a private, secure way, at the lowest layer.

The middle layer comprises the Centrifuge nominated proof-of-stake chain and the artifacts required to run real-world use cases as decentralized applications: NFTs linked by Anchors to privately shared documents off-chain. The first application is called “Tinlake” soon to evolve into the “Centrifuge App.” Other projects could build their own apps on top of the Centrifuge protocol, which is starting to happen: FinTech issuers are working on integrating automatic tokenization into their own technology platforms, one issuer is building a new UI specific to their asset class, and more.

The top layer connects Centrifuge to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) apps, such as Maker and Aave, where DeFi users have access to RWA lending.

Centrifuge uses its own native token - the Centrifuge (CFG) token. It incentivizes validators and nominators to participate through a block reward. Similar to other chains, the token is used to pay fees for transactions and services, including storing business data for the long term and participating in governance. Users of Centrifuge can obtain rewards paid in CFG. These rewards are paid for through inflation. A balancing burning mechanism, where a portion of the fees are burnt, could help to stabilize token supply in the long term.

As Centrifuge grows in transaction volume, the CFG token is poised to accrue value from increased fees, governance, and burning mechanisms.

Bridging Real-World Assets

Centrifuge is the platform allowing the exchange of value as shown:

Source: Centrifuge

Final borrowers: e.g., entrepreneurs needing working capital to buy a property to “fix and flip” (example taken from New Silver, one of the first asset originators on Tinlake).
Asset originators (AO): takes care of tokenizing (into NFTs) the assets (e.g., houses) and provides borrowers with fiat currency.
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV): an entity set up by the AO in a cookie-cutter way (framework provided by Centrifuge) to facilitate the legal agreements. It legally holds the tokenized assets and theoretically can be sued in real life (IRL) by the lenders or sue the final borrowers on default.
Lenders: individual investors or Maker vaults accepting Centrifuge-issued ERC-20 tokens in exchange for DAI.

DROP and TIN are ERC-20 tokens specific for each lending pool (e.g., New Silver 2), representing the senior and junior tranches, respectively. The senior tranche gets stable and predictable interest and is the first to be paid back. The junior tranche takes on default risk by being the last party to be paid back and taking first loss, and in return, collects the difference between the (higher) interest paid by the borrowers and the (lower) interest paid out to senior tranche holders.

Asset originators invest a portion of their working capital in the junior tranche to signal to the market that they have skin in the game. This portion is visible in the Centrifuge app under “Junior provided by Issuer.”

Real Life Asset Pools

In February 2020, Centrifuge was preparing to launch with a handful of asset originators.

At the time of writing, there are 11 active pools on Tinlake, the decentralized app built on Centrifuge. The pools cover a range of real-world use cases, as shown:

Link to Pools: https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/

Protocol Performance

Centrifuge set out to prove to the world that its model works, and the protocol has seen steady growth in TVL since last summer. After initial experimentation and yield farming (CFG rewards), the number of investors has consolidated, but the average ticket size has increased.

As of mid-December, high net worth individuals had the most significant share of the value locked, with protocols (currently only Maker) following second.

Centrifuge Investor Onboarding

Centrifuge is not an RWA financing app. Centrifuge is an on-chain securitization platform that provides the architecture and financial primitives for RWA financing apps to be built on top of. Those apps will be open, decentralized, and permissionless.

- Jeroen Offerijns, CTO, 2021-12-11

Centrifuge and other involved parties need to “Know Your Customer” (KYC), something they have solved by using Securitize, which takes care of storing and validating a users' name, email, physical address, local tax ID, and a copy of the user’s passport.

Once KYC is passed, a contractual relationship with the Asset Originator (e.g., New Silver) is established. This is in the form of a contract on Docusign. The contract has 41 pages.

The contract stipulates arbitration in the state of Delaware and explicitly waives the right to a court trial. This seems to have become a common way of reducing risk for the company.

Another step in the process is the necessity to fill in a US tax form, known as W8BEN. The PDF form contains some helpful hints, as it may be difficult for some users to find the required information regarding specific clauses of tax treaties and percentages of tax withholding.

It remains to be seen how this process can evolve in the future and to what extent it is suitable for non-professional investors. Having to sign a 41-page-contract and submitting a US tax form may be a deterrent for some users and may seem miles away from the ease and playfulness of DeFi.

Aave Real-World Assets

Aave just launched the “Real World Assets Market.” The company (a Centrifuge spin-off, soon to be a DAO) behind it still requires KYC and a subscription agreement, but it is lighter than the current one. The DAO then plays the role of the Lender, which is relied upon for taking any recovery steps in case the loans become non-performing. Essentially, users invest in an Aave pool backed by different RWA collateral. The APY will be floating based on the utilization of the pool. Centrifuge is hoping for a TVL of $25-50M, representing about 50-100% of the current TVL.

Centrifuge’s strategy is to focus more on professional, institutional investors, who have more assets to invest, have a longer time frame than typical retail yield farmers, and are encouraged rather than deterred by the legal frameworks.

Roadmap

Moving Tinlake to Polkadot

Currently, Tinlake is a dApp on Centrifuge, which is interoperable with Ethereum, the blockchain with the largest available capital and liquidity but the highest transaction costs and the slowest transaction speeds. Interoperating with Polkadot removes these two barriers. There will still be a bridge to Ethereum so that the massive liquidity on Ethereum can still be tapped into, but most of the data will be managed on the Substrate chain.

Integrating Centrifuge with Polkadot

In December 2021, Centrifuge started participating in the crowdloan campaign for auction batches 6-11. At the time of writing, it appears Centrifuge will win slot #8 in January 2022. Obtaining a slot will enable the protocol to move its stand-alone chain to a parachain on Polkadot.

By taking advantage of Polkadot’s security model, the security of Centrifuge increases, and therefore the investor’s risk premium goes down. This should benefit the protocol.

By taking advantage of cross-chain bridges within the Polkadot ecosystem (XCMP), Centrifuge gets access to a larger group of investors (compared to a stand-alone chain).

Competition & Risks

Centrifuge is a first player in a very immature market. They expect the market to grow massively and mature over the next five years. This will invariably bring many competitors into the game. As first movers, Centrifuge is well-positioned if they continue to innovate, improve the user experience, and invest in increasing adoption for asset originators and investors.

Potential risk scenarios:

A major player in the real estate financing market adopts similar techniques and implements a similar platform. Through their marketing machinery and strong network of asset originators and investors, they acquire the lion’s share of the market, forcing Centrifuge into other asset classes.
A major player in the crypto lending space branches out into RWA and dilutes Centrifuge’s market share (less likely, since connections IRL are essential).
A major player in the metaverse real estate financing market branches out into RWA. Today it is uncertain who that could be, but anything seems possible in crypto.

Conclusion

Centrifuge is proving that bridging real-world assets to the blockchain is possible. The integration with Maker and Aave shows how Centrifuge is deeply integrated into the DeFi ecosystem.

Given the sheer size of the assets that could be tokenized and put on-chain, it appears there is a massive opportunity for Centrifuge. Seizing the opportunity relies on a combination of well-established legal frameworks in the jurisdictions Centrifuge operates in and a well-functioning technology stack ranging from P2P messaging to blockchain bridges and token economics.

However, many issues may still need to be solved, especially on the KYC user experience side, before RWA transactions are as seamless as today’s crypto-only DeFi transactions.

Sector Returns

The markets continue their downward trajectory as this week marks the third week in a row with negative returns across all sectors. Four of the six sectors covered suffered double digit negative returns with Smart Contract Platforms and Web3 within less than one percent apart to be tied for last place. Ultimately Web3 had the highest drawback of -22.09% followed closely by Smart Contract Platforms returning -21.26%. Gaming was the sector with least amount of decline at -6.62%.

Top Assets

All assets ended the week with double digit negative returns. The sector traded with high correlation throughout the week with Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) trading places various times. The two ended the week with almost identical returns, Bitcoin (BTC) having the least losses by a margin of 0.1% returning -11.5%. The asset with the largest decline was Solana (SOL) with a return of -31.7%.

DeFi Assets

Maker (MKR) broke away from the pack on Saturday and traded well above the rest for most of the week but lost momentum towards the end as some of the assets from the sector recovered lost ground. The Dai-issuing platform – MakerDAO – ended the week in second place, returning -14.6%. As the rest of the tokens gained footing, Loopring (LRC) trended upwards faster than the rest but its late week surge was not enough to end the week with a positive return. It finished with a -7.4% decline while the laggard of the sector was Curve (CRV) returning -31.2%.

Smart Contract Platforms

It was a tough week for Smart Contract Platforms as it was the second worst performing sector in the report and recorded double digit negative returns across all assets. Cosmos (ATOM) broke upwards from the group on Monday but quickly lost momentum and rejoined the rest towards the end of the week. Even though Cardano (ADA) was one of the most discussed projects this week due to the launch of the first DEX on the Layer 1, many were frustrated with the congestion that this caused in the network. ADA took third place, losing 18.5% on the week. Cosmos (ATOM) took first place with the least decline of the sector, returning -14.1% while Solana (SOL) took last place for the second time in this recap, ending the week with -31.7%.

Currencies

The Currencies sector traded with similar synchrony to the Top Assets sector with all assets ending the week in double digit negative return territory. Bitcoin (BTC) suffered the least in the sector, returning -11.5% while the worst performer was Zcash, declining 30.1% on the week.

Web3

Even though no sector had an asset end the week with a positive return, Helium (HNT) was the closest one to do so. The decentralized IoT network made a clear U shaped recovery on the week but it was not enough to finish in the green, returning -0.6%. The rest of the assets were left far behind with the next up returning -14.2% (BAT) while Theta (THETA) took the worst hit of the sector, returning -33.3%.

Gaming

While all Gaming assets traded closely for most of the week, two projects: PLA (PLA) and Ultra (UOS) broke out towards the end of the week. Unfortunately this was not enough to give rise to positive returns as PLA (PLA) ended the week with a return of -10.3% while Ultra (UOS) followed closely, returning -10.8%. The worst performer of the pack was Alice (ALICE), ending the week with a substantial 33.3% decline.
